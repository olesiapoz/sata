For simplified and effective multicast service deployments, we propose Information-Centric Cloud-Native Network Function (IC-CNF), which can be used to quickly create a multicast island in which various applications will benefit from a variety of multicast functionalities. To validate the effectiveness of IC-CNF, we implemented an actual system using an emerging microservice technology, i.e., Docker and conducted real-world experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed IC-CNF significantly reduces 4K live video streaming traffic by 71.6% compared with IP-based unicast networking.

Our approach represents the extension of the management characteristics that are available in current implementations of the orchestrators. The presented study also shows a general methodology for experimental evaluation of complex Cloud-native environments. We propose two categories of experiments. Both evaluate the rule-based approach. The first category evaluates the impacts of dynamic adjustment of resources in the context of the Cloud-native execution environment. The second category assesses the influence of the rule engine approach on the autonomic management process. Given the wide range of available experiments, we additionally assume that evaluation is performed from the point of view of the execution environment's resources. This approach tightly embraces the capabilities of the proposed solution realized by the AMoCNA system and demonstrates its usability.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3159001","Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

The essence of the profiling relies on capturing interactions between different perspectives in cloud native applications through a network dependency graph and transforming it to a computational graph neural network. The latter is used to profile different deployed assets like micro-service types, workloads' namespaces, worker machines, management and orchestration machines as well as clusters. As a first phase of the profiling, we consider a fine-grained profiling on microservice types with an emphasis on network traffic indicators. These indicators are collected on distributed Kubernetes (K8S) deployment premises. Experimental results shows good trade-off in terms of accuracy and recall with respect to micro-service types profiling (around 96%). In addition, we used predictions entropy scores to infer anomalies in testing data. These scores allow to segregate between benign and anomalous graphs, where we identified 19 out of 23 anomalies. Moreover, by using entropy scores, we can conduct a root cause analysis to infer problematic micro-services.","2770-7679","978-1-6654-6250-1","10.1109/FNWF55208.2022.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056608","anomaly detection;profiling;cloud native applications;Kubernetes (K8S);Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)","Industries;Root cause analysis;Protocols;Microservice architectures;Telecommunication traffic;Feature extraction;Graph neural networks","","2","","27","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work therefore evaluates existing architecture description languages according to their suitability for representing those architectural aspects specific to the cloud-native style. The evaluation is driven by a recently proposed quality model for which a suitable architectural modeling option is needed.

Many companies are moving their workload toward microservices and profit from the cloud-native paradigm. However, there are still many challenges to overcome to optimize the Quality of Service using autoscaling and resource dimensioning. Autoscaling is defined as the capacity of cloud infrastructure and applications to resize themselves by adjusting the resource pool. Simple autoscaling can be achieved by a feedback-loop based on current workload resource utilization. Called reactive autoscaling, this technique may introduce inconsistency between workload and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a proactive autoscaling framework using a learning-based forecast model to dynamically adjust the resource pool, horizontally (number of replicas) and vertically (resources pool). This framework uses a proactive autoscaling algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve the end-to-end latency for cloud-native applications. We developed a proof of concept to demonstrate this framework and the effectiveness of our proactive algorithm.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322147","Cloud Native application;Autoscaling;Kubernetes;Machine Learning;LSTM;QoS","Cloud computing;Measurement;Containers;Monitoring;Observability;Quality of service;Virtual machining","","10","","23","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

End-to-End (E2E) network slicing candidates present a promising approach to resource allocation and distribution that permit operators to flexibly provide scalable virtualized and dedicated logical networks over common physical infrastructure. Though network slicing promises the provision of services on demand, many of its use cases, such as self-driving cars and Google's Stadia, would require the integration of a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) platform in 5G networks. Edge Computing is envisioned as one of the key drivers for 5G and Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile cellular networks, but its role in network slicing remains to be fully explored. We investigate MEC and network slicing for the provision of 5G service focused use cases. Recently, changes to the cloud-native 5G core are a focus with MEC use cases providing network scalability, elasticity, flexibility, and automation. A cloud-native microservices architecture, along with its potential use cases for 5G network slicing, is envisioned. This paper also elaborates on the recent advances made in enabling E2E network slicing, its enabling technologies, solutions, and current standardization efforts.

Most of the existing solutions, are semi-automated or completely manual approaches, with some of them targeting specific cloud providers/vendors. Furthermore, there is also very limited research that tackles the validation of such applications. Untrusted developers, are able to develop and upload applications to marketplaces, without being audited and verified. Towards addressing the above-mentioned issues, this paper presents a novel, completely automated tool for deploying and monitoring a Kubernetes cluster over OpenStack. Additionally, we propose a tool that provides automatic validation of cloud-native applications. The evaluation of the proposed toolbox resulted in the deployment of Kubernetes clusters with remarkably low overall times, compared to other, manual approaches. The validation process lasted approximately 11 minutes for a containerized application with the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) enabled and approximately 3 minutes for a containerized application with the Kubernetes HPA disabled. These overall times are relatively shorter than several other non-automated approaches.

Widespread adoption of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes have spawned a whole field of industry products, startups and academic research in the field of container networking, typically termed as cloud-native networking. But, what is cloud-native networking? What are the various pieces and how do they fit together? Over recent years, most applications have been deployed on cloud infrastructure. Kubernetes has been the widely adopted orchestrator for these clouds. Application developers in most cases are unaware of the underlying plumbing in Kubernetes that holds their applications running as containers. Networking is an integral part of any Kubernetes environment and efficiently drives the various abstractions provided by it. Needless to say, it greatly effects the performance of applications, which in general have a humongous amount of inter-microservice communication. The impact is even more profound in multiple cloud environments.","","9788770040204","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10229996.pdf&bkn=10229991&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","24 Aug 2023","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Kubernetes (K8s) is the de facto distributed operating system for container orchestration, and the extended version of the Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)– in the Linux (and MS Windows) kernel– is fundamentally changing the approach to cloud-native networking, security, and observability. In this paper, we introduce what eBPF is, its potential for Telco cloud, and review some of the most promising pricing and billing models applied to this revolutionary operating system (OS) technology. These models include schemes based on a data source usage model or the number of eBPF agents deployed on the network, linked to specific eBPF modules. These modules encompass network observability, runtime security, and power dissipation monitoring. Next, we present our eBPF platform, named Sauron in this work, and demonstrate how eBPF allows us to write custom code and dynamically load eBPF programs into the kernel. These programs enable us to estimate the energy consumption of cloud-native functions, derive performance counters and gauges for transport networks, 5G applications, and non-access stratum protocols. Additionally, we can detect and respond to unauthorized access to cloud-native resources in real-time using eBPF. Our experimental results demonstrate the technical feasibility of eBPF in achieving highly performant monitoring, observability, and security tooling for current mobile networks (5G, 5G Advanced) as well as future networks (6G and beyond).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3281480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138542","eBPF;extended Berkeley packet filter;cloud-native observability;cloud-native security;cloud-native networking;cloud-native monitoring;5G;5G Advanced;6G;Kubernetes;K8s","5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Security;Observability;Linux;6G mobile communication;Band-pass filters","","2","","42","CCBYNCND","30 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new cloud-native network functions use container based virtualization instead of virtual machine-based virtualization. These network functions have low resource footprints and low deployment time, making them suitable for a distributed environment. To adopt these new network functions and cloud native approach the network function virtualization vision needs alterations. In this paper, we use cloud-native approach to provide resilience to cloud-native network services.

The cloud native approach changes the way virtual network functions are being composed, deployed, and configured as network services and how these services are being orchestrated and managed at run time. Traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) frameworks are implemented via specialized engines that have been conceived prior to the cloud native era. Thus, they inherit many traits, which impede pivoting to cloud native.

Based on the understanding of the zero trust mechanism of cloud native Microservices system, this paper analyzes the genetic defects in the inherent mechanism of cloud native, especially the service governance framework mechanism, from a new perspective. These genetic defects will not disappear with the intergenerational development of mobile cloud native. Therefore, they are also known as the endogenous security common problems of cloud native. This article presents the endogenous security threats that may be introduced by security flaws such as ""default information authenticity"" and ""ubiquitous data visibility"". Guided by the theory of endogenous security in cyberspace, it proposes the idea and method of using ""zero trust"" to break the ""default trust"" and using ""implicit mapping"" to achieve ""limited visibility"" of user data to solve the common problems of cloud native endogenous security, And a new zero trust gateway architecture ecology and corresponding applicability function quantification load balancing strategy have been reconstructed.

The research, standardization and implementation of this architecture are actively progressing and SRv6 is already adopted in a number of large scale deployments. Effective solutions for Performance Monitoring (PM) of SRv6 networks are strongly needed and there is a lot of activity in this area. A full blown Performance Monitoring solution needs to include: i) Data Plane (as needed to measure metrics such as packet loss and delay); ii) Control Plane (to send commands to the monitoring entities in the nodes); iii) Management Plane (e.g., to collect the measured metrics). Moreover, Big-Data tools and solutions can be applied inside or above the traditional Management Plane boundaries to store and analyze the collected data. In this article we describe SRv6-PM, a solution for Performance Monitoring of SRv6 networks that deals with all the aspects discussed above. SRv6-PM features a cloud-native architecture that supports: i) the ingestion, processing, storage and visualization of PM data using Big-Data tools; ii) the SDN-based control of network routers to drive the performance monitoring operations. In particular, we focus on Loss Monitoring and consider a solution capable of tracking single packet loss events operating in near-real time (e.g., with a time granularity in the order of 10-20 seconds). SRv6-PM is released as open source. We offer a re-usable and extensible platform that can be automatically deployed in different environments, from a single host to multiple servers on private/public clouds and includes a set of Big-Data tools and the SDN control plane.

Nonetheless, this transfor-mation also adds complexity and enlarges the system attack surface, introducing additional vulnerabilities susceptible to being exploited by well-informed and resourceful attackers, especially in case of static defense techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Moving Target Defense (MTD) approach, which proactively intervenes on the lifecycle of cloud-native application components. Such dynamicity serves as deterrent to potential adversaries, making persistence harder, lowering the effectiveness of automated attack tools, and increasing overall complexity and cost. We detail a step-by-step path, ranging from simple to advanced MTD techniques, targeting both stateless and stateful applications within a cloud-native environment.

With the growing popularity of Cloud Native, the following problems have been raised: (i) most Cloud Native applications were designed for making full use of the cloud platform, but their file storage has not been completely optimized for adapting it. (ii) the traditional file system is designed as a utility for storing and retrieving files, usually built into the kernel of the operating systems. But when placing it to a large-scale condition, like a network storage server shared by thousands of computing instances, and stores millions of files, it will be slow and even unstable. (iii) most storage solutions use metadata for faster tracking of files, but the metadata itself will take up a lot of space, and the capacity of it is usually limited. If the file system store metadata directly into hard disk without caching, the tracking of massive small files will be a lot slower. (iv) The traditional object storage solution can't provide enough features to make itself more practical on the cloud such as caching and auto replication.

This attributes to the internal service calls, by which microservices cooperate and communicate with each other, amplifying the effect of application layer DDoS attack. Since different services have varying degrees of sensitivity to an attack, a sophisticated attacker can take advantage of those especially expensive API calls to produce serious damage to the availability of services and applications with ease. To better analyze the severity of and mitigate application layer DDoS attacks in cloud native applications, we propose a novel method to evaluate the effect of application layer DDoS attack, that is able to quantitatively characterize the amplifying effect introduced by the complex structure of application system. We first present the descriptive model of the scenario. Then, Riemannian manifolds are constructed as the state spaces of the attack scenarios, in which attacks are described as homeomorphisms. Finally, we apply differential geometry principles to quantitatively calculate the attack effect, which is derived from the action of an attack and the movement it produces in the state spaces. The proposed method is validated in various application scenarios. We show that our approach provides accurate evaluation results, and outperforms existing solutions.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2024.3374798","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0800700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1636115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10466506","Cloud native applications;distributed denial-of-service;distributed systems;effect evaluation","Cloud computing;Denial-of-service attack;Microservice architectures;Measurement;Security;Computer crime;Software","","","","60","IEEE","11 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similarly, load balancers can also be deployed in containerized cloud environments and managed as a container, simplifying the process of scaling in or out according to the network status or amounts of incoming traffic. In this study, we implemented a containerized high-performance load balancer that distributes traffic using eBPF/XDP within the Linux kernel, which can easily be managed via Kubernetes. We compared the performance of the proposed load balancer with iptables DNAT and loopback based on the RFC2544 performance standard, and also performed tests simulating real-world traffic patterns by using IMIX traffic streams. Our experimental results indicate that the throughput performance of the proposed load balancer is considerably better than that of iptables DNAT; the difference in performance increased with decreasing packet size. The difference in performance between the loopback (representing the theoretical maximum performance limit) and the proposed load balancer was minimal.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3108801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524915","Cloud;datacenter;direct server return;load balancer;multitenant networks","Cloud computing;Containers;Computer architecture;Tools;IP networks;Neutrons;Virtual machine monitors","","12","","55","CCBY","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the class-imbalanced distribution of faults presents obstacles to applying semi-supervised learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose STRCA, a metrics-based semi-supervised self-training approach for root cause analysis. Furthermore, STRCA employs minority priority self-training, which selects pseudo-labels of high quality during generations. Additionally, the stepwise distribution alignment is introduced to rebalance the predicted distribution with gradually decreasing strength. These two strategies mitigate the class-imbalance of data in semi-supervised learning. Experiments on the public dataset show the effectiveness of STRCA with limited labels.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447959","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10447959","root cause analysis;cloud-native system;AIOps;semi-supervised learning;class-imbalanced data","Root cause analysis;Semisupervised learning;Signal processing;Data models;Acoustics;Speech processing","","","","22","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But, what is cloud-native networking? What are the various pieces and how do they fit together? Over recent years, most applications have been deployed on cloud infrastructure. Kubernetes has been the widely adopted orchestrator for these clouds. Application developers in most cases are unaware of the underlying plumbing in Kubernetes that holds their applications running as containers. Networking is an integral part of any Kubernetes environment and efficiently drives the various abstractions provided by it. Needless to say, it greatly effects the performance of applications, which in general have a humongous amount of inter-microservice communication.

The core technology of the mid-platform architecture is Kubernetes, which can be used to automatically deploy, expand and manage the open source system of container applications. It combines the containers that make up the application into logical units for easy monitoring and management.

Ensuring the reliability of these workloads has grown increasingly intricate as a consequence, only further complicated by the continuous evolution of systems supported by CI/CD practices. In this context, Chaos Engineering can play a crucial role in assessing the reliability of these large-scale systems by intentionally introducing adverse conditions and gauging their resilience in inter-connected environments. This controlled approach enables organizations to identify and learn from potential failure points before they escalate into full-blown service degradation and production outages. Yet, the effectiveness of chaos testing hinges on the relevance of the targeted fault scenarios and often relies on arbitrary or intuitive fault injection practices, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. Addressing these challenges, we have developed a chaos-recommendation tool. This tool assesses the real-time behavior and characteristics of workloads and suggests fault injections that can cause disruptions. In this demo, we will illustrate how the Chaos recommendation tool can be used to automatically identify potential failure points for a system and suggest corresponding chaos test cases.

This study investigates the slow provision of infrastructure and the manual deployment of applications at one company in the electric vehicle sector that is focused on building a stable and reliable digital ecosystem for electric motorcycles. The goal is to explore how Cloud-Native Architecture (CNA) and DevOps culture can accelerate those two processes through automation.

This study proposes the implementation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Version Control Systems (VCS), and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The research findings demonstrate that the use of CNA and DevOps culture can reduce the time required for infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, decrease human errors, improve documentation consistency, and enhance overall system reliability within the company environment.

Many approaches have been then proposed to explain the modelling of complex human mobility. Nevertheless, the interaction between a suite of machine learning algorithms and feature impacts has not been completely explored in terms of the memory of past contexts by state-of-the-art works. Moreover, many existing studies have only discussed theories although their feasibility should be tested out in modern application environments and is also important from the view of open access to the proposed framework. This study attempts to fill this gap by proposing an analytical framework which fits modern (cloud-native) settings and elucidating the interplay between metrics and various parameters to help understand mobility in more detail. As a result, the proposed framework has illuminated marked differences among various machine learning algorithms, feature impacts, and metrics given the memory of past contextual information.

The second execution platform integrates both the Hadoop and Mapreduce functionalities. Finally, QoS based cloud computing functionalities (i.e. load balancing, security, resource allocation and network traffic management) is employed at the third structural platform. Likely, we introduced the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) in structural platform for optimal allocation of resources. We adapt a Hadoop cluster to perform the experiment. Also, to conduct the resource allocation experiment we used some of the conventional optimization algorithms such as, ABC, GA and PSO for comparison with our proposed CSA algorithm imposed on the structural platform.

Once the VNFs are onboarded in a cloud network infrastructure, operators need to test VNFs in real-time at the time of instantiation automatically. This paper explicitly analyses the problem of adaptive self-healing of a Virtual Machine (VM) allocated by the VNF with the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. The DRL-based big data collection and analytics engine performs aggregation to probe and analyze data for troubleshooting and performance management. This engine helps to determine corrective actions (self-healing), such as scaling or migrating VNFs. Hence, we proposed a Deep Queue Learning (DQL) based Deep Queue Networks (DQN) mechanism for self-healing VNFs in the virtualized infrastructure manager. Virtual network probes of closed-loop orchestration perform the automation of the VNF and provide analytics for real-time, policy-driven orchestration in an open networking automation platform through the stochastic gradient descent method for VNF service assurance and network reliability. The proposed DQN/DDQN mechanism optimizes the price and lowers the cost by 18% for resource usage without disrupting the Quality of Service (QoS) provided by the VNF.

However, due to the inherent complexity of cloud environments, traditional RCA techniques become insufficient in supporting system administrators in daily incident response routines. This article presents an RCA solution specifically designed for cloud applications, capable of pinpointing failure root causes and recreating complete fault trajectories from the root cause to the effect. The novelty of our approach lies in approximating causal symptom dependencies by synergizing several symptom correlation methods that assess symptoms in terms of structural, semantic, and temporal aspects. The solution integrates statistical methods with system structure and behavior mining, offering a more comprehensive analysis than existing techniques. Based on these concepts, in this work, we provide definitions and construction algorithms for RCA model structures used in the inference, propose a symptom correlation framework encompassing essential elements of symptom data analysis, and provide a detailed description of the elaborated root cause identification process. Functional evaluation on a live microservice-based system demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in identifying root causes of complex failures across multiple cloud layers.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2024.3358823","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10415627","Root cause analysis;event correlation;knowledge mining;cloud-native applications","Cloud computing;Correlation;Semantics;Behavioral sciences;Trajectory;Measurement;Inference algorithms","","","","35","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume that the EON supports different modulation formats (MFs) under impairment constraints that are represented as the maximum transmission reach of the MFs. High spectrum effective MFs provide shorter transmission range what in the case of larger distances triggers the need to use regenerators. We propose new algorithms for regenerator placement in EONs. To address the fact that cloud computing services are provisioned by data centers (DCs) with the use of anycasting, the proposed algorithms include information on DC location and ratio of anycast traffic in the network. Evaluation of proposed algorithms is made in the context of dynamic traffic scenario with the objective to minimize blocking probability experienced in a network with regenerator location yielded by a particular placement algorithm. Results of experiments show that the cloud-aware location of regenerators can significantly reduce the blocking probability as well as reduce the number of used regenerators comparing to classical approaches.","2161-2064","978-1-4673-7880-2","10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7193487","elastic optical networks;dynamic routing;optimization;regenerator placement","Heuristic algorithms;Routing;Optical fiber networks;Repeaters;Modulation;Algorithm design and analysis;Context","","8","","12","IEEE","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Capable of auto-scaling resources for customer workloads can significantly improve resource utilization, thus greatly reducing the cost. Here we leverage the AI4DL framework [1] to characterize workload and discover resource consumption phases. We advance the existing technology to an incremental phase discovery method that applies to more general types of ML workload for both training and inference. We use a time-window MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict phases in containers with different types of workload. Then, we propose a predictive vertical auto-scaling policy to resize the container dynamically according to phase predictions. We evaluate our predictive auto-scaling policies on 561 long-running containers with multiple types of ML workloads. The predictive policy can reduce up to 38% of allocated CPU compared to the default resource provisioning policies by developers. By comparing our predictive policies with commonly used reactive auto-scaling policies, we find that they can accurately predict sudden phase transitions (with an F1-score of 0.92) and significantly reduce the number of out-of-memory errors (350 vs. 20). Besides, we show that the predictive auto-scaling policy maintains the number of resizing operations close to the best reactive policies.","2159-6190","978-1-7281-8780-8","10.1109/CLOUD49709.2020.00070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284206","Cloud Native;Machine Learning Service;Container;Auto-scaling","Training;Cloud computing;Machine learning;Containers;Predictive models;Multilayer perceptrons;Resource management","","11","","22","IEEE","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Centralized storage, although cost-effective, faces issues of scalability, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities. With decentralized storage, data are distributed across nodes, offering redundancy, data availability, and enhanced security. Unfortunately, decentralized storage introduces its own challenges, such as complex data retrieval processes, potential inconsistencies in data versions, and difficulties in ensuring data privacy and integrity in a distributed setup. Effectively managing these challenges calls for innovative techniques. In response, this paper introduces a decentralized storage system that melds cloud-native concepts with blockchain technology.

Applications that are cloud-native use a microservice design, which effectively distributes resources to each service they require, allowing them to be flexible and adaptive to a cloud architecture. This paper discusses cloud native approach in detail and compares with the traditional approach to designing, building and deploying applications and highlights the need to switch to cloud native. The four major components of Cloud native architecture are microservices, devops, continuous delivery and containers. The various factors to consider during the design of a cloud native application and the development stack required to do so, are also discussed in detail. Tools such as the 12 factor application, API based design, and microservices, which are essential for cloud native applications, are examined. Some of the other challenges that come with cloud computing are resolved by cloud-native applications. Cloud native solutions, from an economic perspective, provide the full value of the cloud by enabling applications to scale and change more quickly than before. This scalability gives the company new chances to grow their revenue, become more efficient, or provide better customer service.","","978-1-6654-5342-4","10.1109/NKCon56289.2022.10126871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10126871","Cloud Native;Containers;Continuous Delivery;Microservices;12 Factor Application","Economics;Cloud computing;Architecture;Scalability;Customer services;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture","","","","18","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To protect distributed edge-based cloud assets from networking-based threats by recognizing suspicious traffic, cloud operators should monitor the overall underlying topology to categorize and identify diversified networking packet traffic, flowing through various paths among virtualized and containerized cloud nodes. Perimeter-based networking security, which employs security appliances in fixed locations, cannot address this visibility challenge. As a result, in this paper, we propose the SmartX Multi-tier Security (Multi-Sec) framework, which aims to provide intuitive and systematic visibility for multi-site edge-cloud security. SmartX Multi-Sec abstracts the underlying networking topology among multi-site edge clusters as multiple onion-ring-based tiers of physical, virtualized, and containerized cloud nodes. It also provides collective DevSecOps automation features for monitoring, visualizing, and filtering targeted networking traffic from the respective tiers of the abstracted networking topology. The resulting flow-centric visibility using SmartX Multi-Sec can be featured with extended Berkeley Packet Filter and eXpress Data Path (eBPF/XDP)-leveraged lightweight flow capture and filtering, three-dimensional onion-ring visualization, and automated deployment of DevSecOps functions. By integrating these features, the Proof-of-Concept (PoC)-version of the SmartX Multi-Sec framework is realized to verify the flexible and scalable flow-centric security for multi-site cloud-native edge clouds.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115523","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)], Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program [Gwanju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)](grant numbers:2019-0-01842); Development of Cloud-Native Key Technologies to Collect and Provide Integrated Training Dataset for Autonomous Driving System(grant numbers:2021-0-01176); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548100","Automated function deployment;lightweight flow capture and filtering;multi-site cloud-native edge clouds;security-oriented flow-centric visibility;three-dimensional visualization","Cloud computing;Security;Peer-to-peer computing;Topology;Network topology;Monitoring;Ports (computers)","","9","","32","CCBY","24 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such scenarios, a load balancer is usually used. To keep the manual labor down, the load balancer should automatically be able to distribute load to the newly added nodes.

By leveraging cloud-native architectures, the stringent 5G services requirements can be satisfied while reducing both CAPEX and OPEX. Concretely, the adoption of microservice software design enables the disaggregation of Telco applications into small independent cloud-native network functions. Theses microservices, deployed as containers, are lightweight and perform in an independent way. However, in spite of its various benefits, microservice architecture raises new challenges to deal with in the network function virtualization (NFV) ecosystem. Typically, the service function chaining (SFC) of cloud-native network functions becomes extremely complex and error-prone due to the high number of microservices. In this paper, we address the problem of 5G traffic steering for cloud-native SFC in microservice based NFV ecosystem. Specifically, we envision and deploy an SDNless SFC framework ensuring efficient traffic steering between cloud-native network functions.

As network softwarization extends to the RAN, empowered through the cellular stack disaggregation, even base station components can be executed as a cloud-native service. As low latency access is needed in the 5G and beyond networks for serving ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) needs to be integrated in the overall architecture. As the user moves among different RANs, the latency of accessing the service needs to be preserved for providing users with a seamless experience. To accomplish such behavior, migrations of the hosted services are needed, though not fully compatible with the cloud-native approach, and placing them closer to the network access point of the user. In this work, we experiment with a cloud-native end-to-end network, enhanced with Follow-me MEC functionalities. Heterogeneous access is provided at the RAN level, using disaggregated base stations, and MEC is integrated on the fronthaul of the network, ensuring low-latency access to services.

However, architects and developers are faced with the challenge of applying such characteristics in a targeted manner to improve selected quality attributes. Hence, we aim to investigate relationships, or more specifically impacts, between architectural characteristics of cloud-native applications, and quality aspects. The architectural characteristics in consideration are based on our recently proposed quality model for cloud-native software architectures. To validate its elements and revise this literature-based quality model, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey among 42 software professionals. While the survey results reinforce the quality model to a fair extent, they also indicate parts requiring a revision. Thus, as an additional contribution, we present an updated version of the quality model incorporating the survey results.

Cloud-native network policies (CNNPs) are used to realize network isolation with respect to security and availability. Due to the dynamic environment, CNNPs are label-based instead of IP-based and take the form of attribute-based access control (ABAC) to obtain good expressivity. To ensure the correctness of network isolation, CNNP verification is an essential but challenging problem given the large scale and frequent updates of cloud-native environments and the operation automation demand. Thus, we design Kano, an efficient, i.e., easy-to-use and fast-to-execute, system for verifying large scale CNNPs at runtime. Kano is operation-friendly, with a proposed intent-based verification language. A bit matrix model with a prefiltration algorithm and a partial-update method is proposed to support fast complete and incremental verification. Kano also generates fix plans for violations to assist operators. Kano is implemented as a CNNP verification system that is used in ABAC cloud-native platforms and is integrated into the popular Kubernetes orchestrator. An evaluation on a large scale network of 100k nodes and about 68k policies shows the efficiency of Kano, with 12.51 seconds for all reachable invariant verification and 0.299 milliseconds for policy addition verification.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3229675","National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:61872212); National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2016YFB1000101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9990602","Cloud native;network verification;attribute-based access control;overlay networks","Cloud computing;Automation;Containers;Runtime;Maintenance engineering;Data structures;Clustering algorithms","","","","49","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite its several advantages, micro-services raise new challenges which slow its adoption down in the NFV ecosystem. Indeed, steering the expected 5G traffic between cloud-native network function is extremely challenging and is still under-investigated. In this paper, we address the service function chaining (SFC) in micro-service based network function virtualization (NFV) ecosystem from the view of the traffic steering. Specifically, we design and implement a cloud-native SFC framework offering efficient traffic steering mechanisms while considering the network state of the underlying NFV infrastructure.

Security is regarded as a technology independent of the cloud native architecture in the initial design, traditional passive defense such as “reinforced” and “stacked” is relied on to achieve system security protection. The lack of intrinsic security mechanisms makes the system capability insufficient when faces the uncertain threat brought by vulnerabilities and backdoors under the ecosystem of opening-up and sharing. The static nature of existing networks and computing systems makes them easy to be compromised and hard to defend, and thus it is urgent to provide intrinsic security and proactive protection against the unpredictable attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a novel paradigm named intrinsic cloud security (iCS) from the perspective of dynamic defense. The dynamic defense provides component-level security, and has complementary and consistency with the cloud native environment. In particular, iCS introduces mimic defense and moving target defense (MTD), and makes full use of the new features introduced by cloud native to implement an intrinsic and proactive defense mechanism with acceptable costs and efficiency. The iCS paradigm achieves seamless integration and symbiosis evolution between security and cloud native.

Through the wide application of softwarization and virtualization, cloud-native approaches can extend even to the RAN, that has been dominated by monolithic non-configurable hardware equipment in the past generations of mobile network access. As such, a cloud-native deployment can cover the end-to-end 5G network architecture, from the Core Network to the base stations, with the respective services benefiting from several advanced features, such as automatic scaling of the deployed functions based on monitored metrics. Through the application of Machine Learning, the evolution of the metrics can be predicted and thus the respective functions can be pro-actively scaled. In this work, we use an end-to-end real-world cloud-native deployment of a 5G network, and deal with two different types of scaling, applied at three different parts of the network: vertical scaling for the base station, and horizontal scaling for control and user plane functions of the core network. We use a real-world dataset for replicating traffic over our setup and closely monitor the evolution of metrics from different parts of the network.

Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) around the world are currently exploring and embracing the digital evolution shifting from monolithic, legacy automation platforms to an application framework of microservices to allow for flexible operations as capabilities and airspace operations evolve. Specific to the US, the ATM automation system of today is comprised of both safety and non-safety critical systems, with mission-essential, efficiency-critical, and mission-support services that are predominately maintained and evolved through multi-year, one contractor-led programs. Although the system has proven resilient, it has not proven to be agile and flexible to allow for advances in capabilities on-board aircraft or in the data integration and sharing with other NAS automation systems. This creates significant overhead in development, sustainability, and operations of the current automation system, and leaves modernization efforts—in terms of new capabilities—in constant investment decision planning cycles, costing agencies not just money, but more time to innovate. To advance aviation into a new generation of interoperability leveraging collaborative frameworks and application specific capabilities, ANSPs must adapt to innovative methods to collect, process, and deliver critical and essential aeronautical, weather, and flight information to air traffic control operators and ultimately to airspace users. Doing so can not only lead to sustaining NAS automation systems while reducing the costs to develop and operate these systems, but it also provides an opportunity to present strategies on how to dramatically reduce the time and integration efforts needed to deploy new capabilities. Leveraging cloud-native technologies and services is a way to realize this automation evolution vision for ANSPs.This paper examines the migration from today’s systems to secure, cloud-native platforms to prove that Mission Services and Mission Applications can be rapidly available / deployable to operators who provide separation and flow management services, using a cyber-secured cloud-native environment. Aeronautical data typically used for tactical decision making is now seen as crucial to the decision-making process in Air Traffic Management (ATM). Integrating global and localized datasets into a digital aviation data platform enhances the capabilities of the solutions and opens the possibilities of leveraging big data analytics and microservices to compute trajectory predictions (TP), demand capacity balancing (DCB), arrival and departure sequencing, airspace delay, among others, in real-time to achieve operator-driven mission objectives. Technology has reached a state of maturity, especially in cloud and hybrid cloud solutions, to support safety of life operations, like ATM. This paper identifies approaches that are being considered for that migration to support the integration of new airspace entrants, the use of application services to provide a dynamic, evolutionary ATM platform, and addresses some of the safety and security strategies that must be considered for this evolution.","2155-7209","978-1-6654-3420-1","10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594313","Automation;ATM;Cloud-native;Microservices","Automation;Costs;Online banking;Clouds;Safety;Stakeholders;Security","","1","","7","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These cloud-native VNFs capitalize on microservices and containers to achieve improved scalability, agility, and portability. However, managing these cloud-native VNFs, particularly in edge computing scenarios, presents inherent complexities.

It is undeniable that migrating legacy telco applications to microservice-based architectures accelerates and facilitates the development of new network services while offering a high level of granularity. However, cloud native raises new operational challenges. In order to achieve an efficient management of network services, new solutions are required to monitor and track widely distributed cloud native network functions while considering their specificity. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework, 5GC-Observer, for the observability of cloud native 5G network services. To the best of our knowledge, no such a solution has been found to date. To achieve its goal, 5GC-Observer relies on the eBPF technology to monitor the network traffic circulating between the 5G core components and report telemetry data. Besides, we leverage a statistical method to detect Quality of Service degradation based on reported telemetry data. Such an approach highlights the richness of the data acquired by our solution and its capability to detect unexpected network-related anomalies. The latter are not detectable through standard observability solutions. Performance evaluation shows that our solution generates low overhead while giving insight into the 5G core system and its internal and external exchanges.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-7716-1","10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154433","5G;Cloud native;CNF;Kubernetes;Observability;Monitoring;Logging;Non-intrusive;eBPF","Degradation;5G mobile communication;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Telemetry;Stakeholders","","","","47","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current SecaaS approaches do not efficiently handle the increasing threats to computer systems and applications. For example, requests for security assessments drastically increase after a high-risk security vulnerability is disclosed. In such scenarios, SecaaS applications are unable to dynamically scale to serve requests. A root cause of this challenge is employment of architectures not specifically fitted to cloud environments. Cloud native design patterns resolve this challenge by enabling certain properties e.g. massive scalability and resiliency via the combination of microservice patterns and cloud-focused design patterns. However adopting these patterns is a complex process, during which several security issues are introduced. In this work, we investigate these security issues, we redesign and deploy a monolithic SecaaS application using cloud native design patterns while considering appropriate, layered security counter-measures i.e. at the application and cloud networking layer. Our prototype implementation out-performs traditional, monolithic applications with an average Scanner Time of 6 minutes, without compromising security. Our approach can be employed for designing secure, scalable and performant SecaaS applications that effectively handle unexpected increase in security assessment requests.","","978-1-5386-3684-8","10.1109/SmartCloud.2017.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8118424","Cloud-Security;Security-as-a-Service;Vulnerability Assessment;Cloud Native Applications","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Databases;Computer security;Resilience;Pipelines","","13","","35","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a MANagement and Orchestration (MANO) framework for the automation of end-to-end (E2E) network slicing with the implementations of the core network (CN) and transport network (TN) slices. The framework is a showcase that follows 3GPP network slice management and 5G core network slicing mechanism, integrates novel bandwidth management techniques, and exploits all open-source approaches with state-of-the-art cloud native technologies. We evaluate the resource overhead of the framework and service throughput under bandwidth policies.","2642-6587","978-1-6654-7534-1","10.1109/SOSE55356.2022.00014","Ministry of Education; Ministry of Science and Technology; Ministry of Economic Affairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912617","end-to-end network slicing;management and orchestration;service based architecture;cloud native","Cloud computing;Automation;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Scalability;Bandwidth;Throughput","","6","","23","IEEE","13 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud-native separates monolithic virtual machines into microservice pods, resulting in higher volumes of signaling and communication flowing through and between microservices. In addition, secure connections in monolithic applications have been replaced by untrusted communication between microservice pods, requiring additional cybersecurity capabilities. Access control systems were created to provide reliability and limit access to an organization’s assets. However, due to technology's constant evolution and dynamicity, these conventional security systems lack the security to protect an organization’s information because they were created to address access control for known users. For 5G based cloud native technology, these access controls need to be taken further by implementing a Zero Trust model to secure one’s essential assets for all users within the system. Zero Trust is implemented in an access control system under the concept ""Never Trust, Always Verify"".

Different from the traditional data centers, the novel cloud-native infrastructure brings new challenges to resolve the incast issues: the underlying network fabric/configurations are managed by the cloud vendors and the cloud-native applications running on the virtualized/containerized platform are agnostic to the network.We design DySched, a novel middleware to relieve the largescale incast issues of RDMA applications, without any dependencies on network fabric/configuration (topology, flow control, congestion notification) in a cloud-native environment. DySched creatively utilizes the inherent time cost of posting RDMA requests to determine the inflight data allocation of each RDMA connection. DySched thus achieves an ideal full bandwidth utilization and no congestion at the receiver side. DySched has been deployed in two typical clusters in Alibaba Cloud.

In such cloud-native environments, proactive decisions can be accomplished through Machine Learning models, which are efficiently trained for specific metrics that reflect the network demand. In this work, we use a real cloud-native telecommunications network and real traffic patterns, and evaluate four different Machine Learning methods for predicting the incoming demand.

To improve the overall performance of multiple DL jobs, Fluid co-orchestrate the data cache and DL jobs by arranging job scheduling in an appropriate order and can also schedule data cache and DL jobs on the same node to realize cache affinity. Experimental results show significant performance improvement of each individual DL job which uses dynamic computing resources with Fluid. For scheduling multiple DL jobs with same datasets, Fluid achieves around 2x performance speedup when integrated with existing widely-used and cutting-edge scheduling solutions through the appropriate job scheduling order.

Widespread adoption of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes have spawned a whole field of industry products, startups and academic research in the field of container networking, typically termed as cloud-native networking. But, what is cloud-native networking? What are the various pieces and how do they fit together? Over recent years, most applications have been deployed on cloud infrastructure. Kubernetes has been the widely adopted orchestrator for these clouds. Application developers in most cases are unaware of the underlying plumbing in Kubernetes that holds their applications running as containers.

For enterprise‐ready Cloud Native applications, it is often not enough to simply focus on the updating of the packages on a host. In the Cloud Native world, the long life of servers is usually not a familiar problem because in cloud environments we should aim to build cattle and not pets. This chapter looks at some of the security details that professionals might focus on when hardening a machine image. The benefits of enforcement include predictable behavior, identically configured and better managed systems, easier patching, a more secure security posture, and predictable lifecycles for professionals' servers. The default Linux kernel includes a number of tunable aspects that can be tweaked, but bear in mind that we do not just want to switch on or disable various features.","","9781119824534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932316.pdf&bkn=9932135&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Task analysis;Linux;Benchmark testing;Containers;Encryption;Optimized production technology","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Widespread adoption of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes have spawned a whole field of industry products, startups and academic research in the field of container networking, typically termed as cloud-native networking. But, what is cloud-native networking? What are the various pieces and how do they fit together? Over recent years, most applications have been deployed on cloud infrastructure. Kubernetes has been the widely adopted orchestrator for these clouds. Application developers in most cases are unaware of the underlying plumbing in Kubernetes that holds their applications running as containers.

This work presents a scalable system for large-scale file detection in high-speed networks. A multi-level approach using packet sampling with rolling and block hashing is introduced. We show that such approach together with a well tuned implementation can perform detection of a large number of files on the network at 10 Gbps using standard hardware. The use of packet sampling enables easy distribution of the monitoring processing functionality, and allows for flexible scaling in a cloud environment. Performance experiments on the most run-time critical hashing parts shows a single-thread performance consistent with 10Gbps line rate monitoring. The file detectability is examined for three data sets over a range of packet sampling rates. A conservative sampling rate of 0.1 is demonstrated to perform well for all tested data sets. It is also shown that knowledge of the file size distribution can be exploited to allow lower sampling rates to be configured for two of the data sets, which in turn results in lower resource usage.","2157-4960","978-1-5386-3662-6","10.1109/NTMS.2018.8328746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328746","","Monitoring;Databases;Metadata;Hardware;Throughput;Forensics;System analysis and design","","1","","14","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Microservice architecture also becomes the de facto choice for designing a modern Cloud Native Network Function (CNF) due to its ability to decouple components of each CNF into multiple independently manageable microservices. Even though taking advantage of microservice architecture in designing CNFs solves specific problems, this additional granularity makes estimating resource requirements for a Production Environment (PE) a complex task and sometimes leads to an over-provisioned PE. Traditionally, performance engineers dimension each CNF within a Service Function Chain (SFC) in a smaller Performance Testing Environment (PTE) through a series of performance benchmarks. Then, considering the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints of a Service Provider (SP) that are guaranteed in the Service Level Agreement (SLA), they estimate the required resources to set up the PE. In this paper, we used a machine learning approach to model the impact of each microservice's resource configuration (i.e., CPU and memory) on the QoS metrics (i.e. serving throughput and latency) of each SFC in a PTE. Then, considering an SP's Service Level Objectives (SLO), we proposed an algorithm to predict each microservice's resource capacities in a PE. We evaluated the accuracy of our prediction on a prototype of a cloud native 5G Home Subscriber Server (HSS). Our model showed 95%-78% accuracy in a PE that has 2-5 times more computing resources than the PTE.","","978-1-7281-5684-2","10.1109/NetSoft48620.2020.9165482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165482","Network Function Virtualization;Cloud Native Network Functions;Machine Learning;Service Level Agreement;Quality of Service","Quality of service;Measurement;Cloud computing;Resource management;Benchmark testing;Virtualization;Computer architecture","","8","","26","IEEE","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be compliant with such regulatory frameworks, data controllers must provide data subjects with precise information about the collection, processing, storage, and transfer of personal data. To do so, respective facts and details must be compiled and always kept up to date. In traditional, rather static system environments, this inventory (including details such as the purposes of processing or the storage duration for each system component) could be done manually. In current circumstances of agile, DevOps-driven, and cloud-native information systems engineering, however, such manual practices do not suit anymore, making it increasingly hard for data controllers to achieve regulatory compliance. To allow for proper collection and maintenance of always up-to-date transparency information smoothly integrating into DevOps practices, we herein propose a set of novel approaches explicitly tailored to specific phases of the DevOps lifecycle most relevant in matters of privacy-related transparency and accountability at runtime: Release, Operation, and Monitoring. For each of these phases, we examine the specific challenges arising in determining the details of personal data processing, develop a distinct approach and provide respective proof of concept implementations that can easily be applied in cloud native systems. We also demonstrate how these components can be integrated with each other to establish transparency information comprising design- and runtime-elements. Furthermore, our experimental evaluation indicates reasonable overheads.

This can adversely impact their performance, particularly when stragglers manifest in individual BSP supersteps. Existing BSP resource management solutions assume the same execution time for individual tasks at every superstep, which is not always the case. To address these limitations, we present a dynamic resource management middleware for cloud-native BSP applications comprising a heuristics algorithm that determines effective resource configurations across multiple supersteps while considering dynamic workloads per superstep, and trading off performance improvements with reconfiguration costs. Moreover, we design dynamic programming and reinforcement learning approaches that can be used as pluggable strategies to determine whether and when to enforce a reconfiguration.

For online Internet of Things (IoT) applications, characterized by dynamic and diverse requirements, achieving optimal quality of service hinges on a resource-efficient yet performant SFC caching strategy, which is a critical challenge. Besides, despite the performance boost and flexibility brought by modern cloud-native technology, it brings the cold-start problem due to the requirement for runtime image transmission and booting-up, resulting in a nonnegligible launch latency. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes cloud-native parallel SFC caching (CPSC) framework, a novel approach to address the CPSC problem in edge–cloud networks leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL), seeking an efficient resource utilization of the edge–cloud network with consideration of SFC processing performance and cold-start suppressing. Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based embeddings are adopted for topology-aware feature extraction of the substrate edge–cloud network as well as the incoming SFC caching requests.

Unfortunately, the restricted bandwidth of in-network servers becomes the main bottleneck. Although tile-based video streaming is promising to reduce video transmission size while keeping user QoE, it highly depends on the accuracy of user FoV prediction, which existing prediction methods cannot guarantee.

This paper proposes a method of building Exploitable Vulnerability Database for Cloud-Native App (CNA). In this paper, a new machine-oriented structured vulnerability intelligence format is designed to store vulnerability information to automate the processing of vulnerability information. A large number of cloud-native application vulnerabilities have been tested and a modularized test process has been proposed as a form of prototype that automatically builds a Deliberated Vulnerable Environment (DVE) in a pipelined manner using the DevOps toolchain. This prototype system can directly access the vulnerability database to build vulnerability intelligence and extract key information from it. The affected software versions from the vulnerability intelligence are used to fetch all vulnerable software base images by version comparison. A CNA image containing the desired vulnerability can be generated from the base image with post-installation configurations. A Vulnerability Auto-Validation Framework is used to verify whether it is exploitable or not. After this process, a CNA image with the DVE, is automatically pushed to an image registry. This DVE image can be widely used in different cases, such as sandbox, honeypot, cyber range, etc. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that it can build and deliver DVE images from the proposed vulnerability intelligence. This paper uses real vulnerabilities in National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to experiment on the prototype system. The experiment uses the machine-oriented structured vulnerability intelligence designed in this paper as the prototype system input, and successfully releases the DVE image when the vulnerability intelligence is accurate. What's more, the building process and result of the DVE image can be inspected and visualized through CI/CD pipeline so that to increase the confidence of the veracity of the vulnerability intelligence.","","978-1-7281-4390-3","10.1109/ITNEC48623.2020.9084733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9084733","Information Security;Vulnerability Database;DevOps;Deliberated Vulnerable Environment","Visualization;Databases;Conferences;Buildings;Pipelines;Prototypes;Software","","1","","16","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LLMs have the ability to produce content that is both coherent and contextually relevant. Notwithstanding, there exist notable obstacles in effectively implementing and overseeing these models within operational settings, especially in infrastructures that are cloud native. A cloud-native system for optimizing and delivering live learning modules on Kubernetes clusters is presented in this study. There are many obstacles in the way of effectively deploying inference services on the cloud. After obtaining a trained model, cloud operators need to specify hardware configurations for every model-serving container. These settings cover a wide range of topics, including CPU core counts, GPU specs, GPU RAM, possible setups for GPU sharing, and runtime parameters like batch size. When combined, these factors provide a vast and intricate configuration space. By utilizing the declarative resource management that Kubernetes provides, the suggested approach leverages declarative resource management capabilities of Kubernetes and allows users to easily train and serve LLMs on those clusters. Kubernetes clusters from a variety of cloud providers, including KIND (provisioned on bare metal), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), are specifically supported by the framework. This Kubernetes custom resource enables users to maximize the performance and cost-effectiveness of LLM deployments by utilizing Kubernetes’ scalability, flexibility, and resource allocation properties and allows to maintain the stable state with use of operators and watch pattern.","","979-8-3503-7519-0","10.1109/ICAAIC60222.2024.10575306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10575306","Kubernetes;Orchestration;API;Operator","Runtime;Scalability;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;Metals;Machine learning;Natural language processing","","","","15","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conservatively keeping applications local will deprive these complex applications of abundant compute capacity, wider system integration, and the potential for collaborative control efforts. Feedback control systems are unlike other cloud applications - their performance and objectives can be formally defined, they require timely feedback, and they are sensitive to variations in system performance and noise. Although resources are plentiful, the cloud is a noisy and latency prone execution environment, detrimental to feedback control system. In this paper, we evaluate a set of cloud platforms and infrastructures with the intention of hosting feedback control systems. In lower levels of the software stack, we observe differences between clouds. Further up in the stack we see the disadvantages of applying cloud native platforms. With an understanding of expected performance we proceed to evaluate a simple control strategy and show how the sensitive nature of control can cause a seemingly adequate cloud platform to pose a high risk, while a seemingly inadequate platform can positively affect the performance of our proposed controller.","","978-0-7381-2394-3","10.1109/UCC48980.2020.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9302820","Cloud-native;feedback control systems;cyber physical systems;control over the cloud;Control-as-a-Service","Cloud computing;Feedback control;Control systems;Software;Reliability;Production;Adaptive control","","9","","18","IEEE","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this in mind, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has evolved the ETSI NFV reference architecture to adapt to CN and fill the gap with the NFV framework, including containers and ZeroTouch, among other capabilities. Open-source Management & Orchestration (MANO) initiatives, such as Open Source MANO (OSM), are promoting this adoption giving support to CN solutions based on containers.

To cope with the rising demand for ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in beyond 5G networks, the provision of dedicated secure networks closer to the users is essential. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that provides data and computational resources closer to mobile users. However, MEC servers are resource-constrained, and offering dedicated service-specific network slices at the edge in a highly dynamic and mobile environment is challenging. Network slicing and MEC are being evolved by two different standardization bodies that limit their integration and raise mobility challenges that deserve more attention. We propose a cloud-native microservices architecture for network slice mobility management in MEC that permits each MEC slice to be distributed as stateless and independently deployable microservices. The proposal separates the MEC slice operational data and the user context, as each network function in a MEC slice stores the context in a separate shared database. The proposed architecture leverages new SDN extended federation modules in compliance with the ETSI requirements for inter-MEC system coordination. The federation modules support a more flexible and scalable creation of network slices at MEC servers, efficient resource utilization, and mobility of network slices across MEC servers. The simulation results show that our proposed architecture outperforms the existing SDN-based approaches for network slicing in MEC by achieving high slice acceptance rates and reduced slice migration delay.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3292520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173679","5G;cloud-native;microservices;multiaccess edge computing (MEC);network slice mobility (NSM);ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC);vehicle-toeverything (V2X)","Network slicing;Servers;Microservice architectures;Cloud computing;Vehicle dynamics;Internet of Things;Vehicle-to-everything","","2","","50","IEEE","5 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A number of open research problems are discussed to call for help from the design automation community with the focus on new automation methodologies in building a cloud-native end-to-end edge computing platform.","1558-2434","978-1-6654-2324-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9256419","AI;IoT;Edge Computing;Edge Cloud;Cloud Native;Streaming Video Analytics;Industry 4.0;Resource Management","Cloud computing;Edge computing;Image edge detection;Artificial intelligence;5G mobile communication;Virtualization;Containers","","2","","54","","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the agility of cloud native network functions (CNFs) demonstrates significant promise, virtualization and softwarization severely degrade the performance of such network functions. Considerable efforts were expended to improve the performance of virtualized systems, and at this stage 10 Gbps throughput is a real target even for container/VM-based applications. Nonetheless, the current performance of CNFs with state-of-the-art enhancements does not meet the performance requirements of next-generation 6G networks that aim for terabit-class throughput. The present pace of performance enhancements in hardware indicates that straightforward optimization of existing system components has limited possibility of filling the performance gap. As it would be reasonable to expect a single silver-bullet technology to dramatically enhance the ability of CNFs, an organic integration of various data-plane technologies with a comprehensive vision is a potential approach. In this paper, we show a future vision of system architecture for terabit-class CNFs based on effective harmonization of the technologies within the wide-range of network systems consisting of commodity hardware devices. We focus not only on the performance aspect of CNFs but also other pragmatic aspects such as interoperability with the current environment (not clean slate). We also highlight the remaining missing-link technologies revealed by the goal-oriented approach.","2325-5609","978-1-6654-4005-9","10.1109/HPSR52026.2021.9481848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481848","6G;Network functions virtualization;Cloud native;Data-plane","6G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Network slicing;Systems architecture;Transforms;Switches;Throughput","","2","","47","IEEE","15 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, the restricted storage and bandwidth of in-network servers could become the main bottleneck. To this end, we present ${\sf EMS}$EMS, a novel UHD video streaming framework, by integrating Erasure-coded storage with Multi-source Streaming. We respectively introduce a deadline-aware and a latency-sensitive metric to indicate the service quality of video servers and advocate a federated learning paradigm for the adaptive service quality update, including a reinforcement learning based multi-server selection (i.e., user local training) and a global service quality aggregation. To facilitate user local training without sacrificing streaming Quality-of-Experience (QoE), we cast the multi-server selection associated with the restriction on the average number of selected servers per video chunk into two kinds of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models in terms of the proposed service quality metrics. We design lightweight Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) based algorithms with a theoretical performance guarantee.

The distributed and stateful nature of big data platforms (e.g., Hadoop-based cluster) makes the management of these platforms a challenging task. This paper aims to design and implement a scalable cloud native Hadoopbased big data platform using MiCADO, an open-source, and a highly customisable multi-cloud orchestration and auto-scaling framework for Docker containers, orchestrated by Kubernetes. The proposed MiCADO-based big data platform automates the deployment and enables an automatic horizontal scaling (in and out) of the underlying cloud infrastructure. The empirical evaluation of the MiCADO-based big data platform demonstrates how easy, efficient, and fast it is to deploy and undeploy Hadoop clusters of different sizes.

Workflow offers an effective way to assemble disparate services and interacts with them to construct business logic for user requests. Meanwhile, workflow engines are responsible for the control of workflow execution. However, existing engines usually support interaction between workflows and services or computing resources by tight binding approaches, which lack flexibility and scalability. Therefore, a flexible and decoupled architecture is essential to support automatic workflow management. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel service-centered cloud-native workflow architecture - SCAFE. The introduction of the service layer in SCAFE decouples the upper business services and lower execution resources, facilitating the independent and joint management of three execution objects (request - service - execution instance) involved in the cloud workflow lifecycle. We present a 2-stage scheduling model for the new architecture to support customized service optimization and resource-aware task scheduling. In addition, a fault-tolerant mechanism is integrated into resolving task execution exceptions quickly.

The objective of each provider is to maximize its revenue while minimizing computation, management, and transmission costs, coping with physical constraints.

However, the database clusters suffer from low utilization of local storage because of the imbalance between CPU and storage capacities within each node. For instance, the OceanBase distributed database cluster, with hundreds of PB local storage capacity, only utilizes around 40% of its local storage. Although disaggregated storage (EBS) can enhance storage utilization by provisioning the CPU and storage independently on demand, they suffer from performance bottlenecks and high costs. In this paper, we propose LightPool, a high-performance and lightweight storage pool architecture large-scale deployed in the OceanBase clusters, enhancing storage resource utilization. The key idea of LightPool is aggregating cluster storage into a storage pool and enabling unified management. In particular, LightPool adopts NVMe-oF to enable high-performance storage resource sharing among cluster nodes and integrate the storage pool with Kubernetes to achieve flexible management and allocation of storage resources. Furthermore, we design the hot-upgrade and hot-migration mechanisms to enhance the availability of LightPool. We have deployed LightPool on over 8500 nodes in production clusters. Statistics show that LightPool can improve storage resource utilization from about 40% to 65%. Experimental results show that the extra latency from LightPool is only about 2.1 μs compared to local storage. Compared to OpenEBS, LightPool enhances bandwidth up to 190.9% in microbenchmarks and throughput up to 6.9% in real-world applications. LightPool is the best practice to deploy NVMe-oF (NVMe/TCP) in the production environment.

The proposed method, termed Service Affinity Graph-based Approach, employs a graph-based model to model the interactions among microservices. It formulates the service placement as a minimum-weight k-cut problem and utilizes an approximation algorithm for service clustering. This approach is realized through a conceptual framework that takes into account a wide range of optimization objectives, ranging from enhancing application performance and enforcing data privacy to optimizing operational costs. In addition to presenting the SAGA framework in details, this paper conducts an in-depth empirical evaluation using a prototype deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. The results demonstrate a mean latency improvement of 23.40 %, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

The new technologies available in this ecosystem allowed healthcare institutions to improve their workflows, data access, sharing, and visualization using standardized formats. The migration of these services to the cloud enables a remote diagnostic environment, where professionals can review the studies remotely and engage in collaborative sessions. Despite the advantages of cloud-ready environments, their adoption has been slowed down by the demanding scenario high-resolution medical images pose. Some studies can have several gigabytes of data that need to be managed and consumed in the network. In this context, performance constraints of the software platforms can result in severe denial of clinical service. This work proposes a highly scalable cloud platform for extreme medical imaging scenarios. It provides scalability with auto-scaling mechanisms that allow dynamic adjustment of computational resources according to the service load.","2642-7389","978-1-6654-9792-3","10.1109/ISCC55528.2022.9912933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912933","Kubernetes;Distributed Systems;Medical Image;Horizontal scalability;PACS;DICOM","Pathology;Image resolution;Scalability;Ecosystems;Computer architecture;Medical services;Throughput","","1","","14","IEEE","19 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One recurrent motif is the stateless design of applications, which aims to decouple the life-cycle of application states from the life-cycle of individual application instances. Application data is written to and read from cloud databases, deployed close to the application code to ensure low latency bounds on state access. When applying a stateless design, the performance of the cloud service is often limited by the cloud database. In order not to become a bottleneck, database instances are distributed on multiple hosts, and strive to ensure data locality for all application functions. However, the shared nature of certain states, and the inevitable dynamics of the application workload necessarily lead to inter-host data access. If the service is geographically distributed, this is even across data centers and edge servers resulting in a significant delay. To minimize the service performance loss due to the stateless design of applications, we propose a latency and access pattern aware state storage method, called state-layer, that can be easily applied in any kind of key-value store with the ability of deciding where to store replicas in the cluster and measure networking/computing delay. By adapting our solution to Anna, a key-value store from academia, we show the proposed state-layer is ideal to use as a cloud database for storing application states. To foster further research in this area, we make our proof-of-concept solution open-source.","2165-963X","978-3-903176-31-7","10.23919/CNSM50824.2020.9269045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9269045","","Servers;Noise measurement;Monitoring;Routing;Cloud computing;Delays;Distributed databases","","6","","16","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When compute infrastructure is distributed towards the edge of networks, efficient use of scarce resources is key meaning the available resources must be fine-tuned to achieve deterministic performance; another vital factor is the energy consumption of such compute which should be carefully managed. In the latest generation of Intel x86 servers, a new capability called Speed Select Technology Turbo Frequency (SST-TF) is available, enabling more targeted allocation of turbo frequency settings to specific CPU cores. This has significant potential in multi-tenant edge compute environments increasingly seen in 5G deployments and is likely to be a key building block for 6G. This paper evaluates the potential application of SST-TF for competing CNFs – a mix of high and low priority workloads - in a multi-tenant edge compute scenario. The targeted application of SST-TF is shown to yield performance benefits compared to the legacy turbo frequency capability in earlier generations of processor (by up to 35%), and when combined with other intelligent resource management tooling can also achieve a net reduction in server power consumption (of 1.7%).","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175455","Performance;Energy Efficiency;CNFs;SST-TF","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Power demand;Energy efficiency;Telecommunications;Servers;Resource management","","2","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

QoT prediction techniques have been used to assure the quality of new lightpaths as well as that of the previously provisioned ones. Traditionally, two different approaches have been used: analytical methods, which take into account most physical impairments that are accurate but complex, and high margin formulas, which require much less computational resources at the cost of high margins. With the recent progress of machine learning (ML) together with software defined networking (SDN), ML has been considered as another option that could be both accurate and that does not consume as many resources as analytical methods. SDN architectures are difficult to scale because they are usually centralized; this is even worse with QoT predictors using ML. In this paper, a solution to this issue is presented using a cloud-native architecture, and its scalability is evaluated using three different ML QoT predictors and experimentally validated in a real wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) over spatial-division multiplexing (SDM) testbed.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.449009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721710","","Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Scalability;Cloud computing;Topology;Telemetry;Optical fiber networks","","2","","","","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design patterns play an essential role in obtaining scalability and reliability in the systems. The various challenges in the architectural designs and automatic decision-making techniques are attained through the aid of Adam optimization techniques integrated with the Internet of Things. Through the process of integration with an adaptive user interface, the changing user needs are monitored by the system. The deep learning techniques help to automatically adapt and optimize itself without any external parameters. This helps to analyze the user interactions and to promote system efficiency with an enhanced performance ratio. The generation of constant streams of data is obtained through the Internet of Things.

The goal of this work is to understand whether a set of five performance-related KPIs depends on the metrics collected at runtime by Kafka, Zookeeper, and other tools (168 different metrics). We considered four weeks worth of runtime data collected from a system running in production. We trained eight Machine Learning algorithms on three weeks worth of data and tested them on one week’s worth of data to compare their prediction accuracy and their training and testing time. It is possible to detect performance-related anomalies with a very high level of accuracy (higher than 95% AUC) and with very limited training time (between 8 and 17 minutes). Machine Learning algorithms can help to identify runtime anomalies and to detect them efficiently. Future work will include the identification of a proactive approach to recognize the root cause of the anomalies and to prevent them as early as possible.","","978-1-6654-6152-8","10.1109/SEAA56994.2022.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10011501","Anomaly Detection;Kafka metrics;Machine Learning;Empirical Study","Measurement;Training;Cloud computing;Runtime;Machine learning algorithms;Time series analysis;Software algorithms","","","","25","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As Docker's popularity soared, a common misconception was that containers could be treated in the same way as virtual machines. There are typically a number of common components on a Linux system that enable the secure use of containers, although new features, or improvements to existing kernel and system features, are augmented periodically. The kernel is important because before other security hardening techniques were introduced in later versions, Docker allowed the ability to disable certain features, and open up specific, otherwise locked‐down, kernel permissions. A little‐known fact is that serverless technologies also embrace containerization, or more accurately lightweight virtualization when it comes to AWS Lambda.","","9781119824534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932346.pdf&bkn=9932135&pdfType=chapter","","Containers;Kernel;Security;Linux;Runtime;Virtual machining;Software","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Kubernetes' default approach to container networks is to provide a flat unrestricted environment where every container can contact every other container. Kubernetes provides a default API, called Network Policy, which can be used by cluster operators and users to restrict access between workloads. Assignment of the IP addresses to pods is governed by the Container Network Interface plugin that's used by the cluster. Services provide a consistent IP address for an application running in a Kubernetes cluster and are necessary because pods, by their very nature, are ephemeral and may move from node to node, causing their IP addresses to change.","","9781119824534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932347.pdf&bkn=9932135&pdfType=chapter","","IP networks;Containers;Databases;Security;Network interfaces;Runtime;Web servers","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

There are unquestionably trade‐offs, but that is almost always the case when security controls are introduced. This Docker functionality is being actively developed, so if professionals have trouble with one version of the installation script, try the other, which might be a more stable version. It is safe to say that Podman handles the running of containers differently than Docker. One difference between Docker and Podman in rootless mode is that Podman does not allocate an IP address by default.","","9781119824534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932394.pdf&bkn=9932135&pdfType=chapter","","Containers;Security;Linux;Runtime;Kernel;Engines;Servers","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Kubernetes clusters can have a number of listening network ports, and several of these are susceptible to attack, if incorrectly configured. This chapter looks at each of the main ports used by Kubernetes clusters in turn from an attacker's perspective, showing what kinds of attacks are possible via that service. Mitigating the risks of misconfiguration is generally a matter of ensuring that each component is correctly configured when the cluster is established and confirming that this secure starting point does not change over time. By default, Kubernetes allows only a limited level of access without authentication; however, it is possible for the API server to be misconfigured to allow attackers additional access. The best way to reduce the risk of attackers fingerprinting clusters via the API server is to restrict access to the port at a network level.","","9781119824534","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9932401.pdf&bkn=9932135&pdfType=chapter","","Servers;Security;Standards;Runtime;IP networks;Authentication;Public key","","","","","","28 Oct 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The standard way of achieving these goals is to decouple the life-cycle of important application states from the life-cycle of individual application instances: states, and data in general, are written to and read from cloud databases, deployed close to the application code. The high performance requirements on the application impose strict latency limits on these storage solutions for state access. Cloud database instances are therefore distributed on multiple hosts in order to strive to ensure data locality for all functions. However, the shared nature of certain states, and the inevitable dynamics of the application workload necessarily lead to inter-host data access within the data center (or even across data centers, if the application requires a multi-data center setup). In order to minimize the inter-host communication due to state externalization, we propose an advanced cloud scheduling algorithm that places functions' states across the hosts of a data center. We create a model for the state placement with the aim of minimizing state access latency, and we prove that it is a complex problem. We therefore propose heuristics for fast and efficient placement methods and we evaluate those across realistic scenarios. We show that our approximations are close to the optimal placement, and in large-scale settings the algorithms take only a few minutes to yield good placement results.","","978-1-7281-4832-8","10.1109/CloudNet47604.2019.9064048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064048","cloud native network functions;state externalization;placement optimization","Noise measurement;Cloud computing;Delays;Servers;Reliability;Databases;Data centers","","8","","17","IEEE","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These activities include updating (i) these services, (ii) their dependencies on third parties, (iii) their configurations, (iv) the configuration of the execution environment, (v) network configurations. The high frequency of updates results in significant configuration complexity that can lead to failures or performance drops. To mitigate these risks, service providers extensively rely on testing techniques, such as metamorphic testing, to detect these failures before moving to production. However, the development and maintenance of these tests are costly, especially the oracle, which must determine whether a system's performance remains within acceptable boundaries. This paper explores the use of a learning method called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to learn about acceptable performance metrics on cloudnative services and identify a metamorphic relationship between the nominal service behavior and the value of these metrics. We investigate the following research question: Is it possible to combine the metamorphic testing technique with learning methods on service monitoring data to detect error-prone reconfigurations before moving to production? We remove the developers' burden to define a specific oracle in detecting these configuration issues. For validation, we applied this proposal on a distributed media streaming application whose authentication was managed by an external identity and access management services. This application illustrates both the heterogeneity of the technologies used to build this type of service and its large configuration space. Our proposal demonstrated the ability to identify error-prone reconfigurations using PCA.","","978-0-7381-2394-3","10.1109/UCC48980.2020.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9302829","Reconfigurations;Metamorphic testing;Principal component analysis;Cloud-native services","Principal component analysis;Testing;Measurement;Streaming media;Servers;Complexity theory;Cloud computing","","3","","25","IEEE","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) based optimization model to solve the function migration scheduling problem so that it meets QoS requirements of each service function (SF) chain. The remarkable points of this work are the following two points. The one is that we consider latency between VNFs/CNFs belonging to an SF chain, avoiding overhead due to their unnecessary migration and resource shortage. And the other is that we consider the case in which each VNF/CNF must be to be deployed strictly to a designated virtual machine (or container). To reduce complexity, we apply an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network (ED-RNN) as a machine learning model to the function migration scheduling problem. Performance evaluations show that the ED-RNN based approach achieves a similar performance as the ILP, while adding the benefits of very low complexity.","2165-963X","978-3-903176-51-5","10.23919/CNSM55787.2022.9964715","Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964715","Service function chaining (SFC);Integer linear programming (ILP);Machine learning (ML);Recurrent neural network (RNN);Cloud-native platform","Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Service function chaining;Quality of service;Containers;Dynamic scheduling;Virtual machining","","","","7","","2 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As applications deploy substantial computing resources in data centers, a fierce competition for network services ensues, marked by stringent quality requirements. Simultaneously, safeguarding the time sensitivity of the main flow becomes imperative. However, prevailing container network solutions primarily ensure service quality through scheduling and orchestration, neglecting the influence of computing resources on network service quality under intense resource competition. Consequently, our focus revolves around exploring the preservation of time-sensitive attributes of primary service network links, aiming to enhance the service quality of container networks in highly competitive computing resource environments. This paper introduces a novel container network solution designed to meet the quality of service requirements for time-sensitive data in container networks. Implemented on the Kubernetes platform, this solution establishes an underlay network structure based on Cilium for transmitting network packets requiring performance guarantees and exhibiting time sensitivity. Utilizing eBPF programs with adjusted CPU affinity for packet forwarding, the solution records packets necessitating quality of service guarantees. Network service quality is ensured through algorithms such as Multiqueue Priority, Earliest TxTime First, Enhancements for Scheduled Traffic, etc. The network packets requiring performance guarantees and time sensitivity refer to the TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) standard. To assess the solution’s effectiveness, we deployed Kubernetes on two directly connected physical servers. Measurements were conducted in scenarios of both idle and highly competitive computing resources, evaluating bandwidth, latency, and jitter of container access packets across different hosts.

In recent years, there have been many excellent efforts to mitigate the effects of cloud cover. However, it has been found that there will be some blurs in the area if a single degraded image is restored by autoencoder-based methods. This letter focuses on removing clouds from single optical remote sensing images by autoencoder-based methods without multitemporal information while at the same time mitigating blurs caused by missing information. Therefore, we propose a novel cloud removal method that combines image inpainting and image denoising, called the Cloud-Aware Generative Network (CAGN). The CAGN consists of two stages: the first stage is a recurrent convolution network for potential cloud region detection and the second is an autoencoder for cloud removal. The method uses a side-guided method that adds attention mechanisms in the first stage to assist in predicting the mask. Furthermore, to update the mask adaptively for restoring degraded image areas greedily, the method embeds partial convolution in the autoencoder to condition the convolution calculation of pixels in the regions of thick clouds at different layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate clearly that CAGN can easily achieve a considerable increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index (SSIM) compared with a competitive baseline model.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2928840","Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2016201); National Defense Science and Technology Innovation Zone(grant numbers:18-H863-00-TS-002-018-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884095","Attention mechanism;cloud detection;cloud removal;generative network;remote sensing","Convolution;Remote sensing;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Image reconstruction;Training","","21","","20","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Potential and existing security holes can be identified during vulnerability assessments and security breaches could be averted. However, the unique nature of cloud computing environments requires more dynamic assessment techniques. The proliferation of cloud services and cloud-aware applications introduce more cloud vulnerabilities. But, current measures for identification, mitigation and prevention of cloud vulnerabilities do not suffice. Our investigations indicate a possible reason for this inefficiency to lapses in availability of precise, cloud vulnerability information. We observed also that most research efforts in the context of cloud vulnerability concentrate on IaaS, leaving other cloud models largely unattended. Similarly, most cloud assessment efforts tackle general cloud vulnerabilities rather than cloud specific vulnerabilities. Yet, mitigating cloud specific vulnerabilities is important for cloud security. Hence, this paper proposes a new approach that addresses the mentioned issues by monitoring, acquiring and adapting publicly available cloud vulnerability information for effective vulnerability assessments. We correlate vulnerability information from public vulnerability databases and develop Network Vulnerability Tests for specific cloud vulnerabilities.

They apply critical functions (e.g. security, routing or quality of service) to traffic to enhance the network operators and application consumers experience. Today these services are inserted physically on the data-forwarding plane without providing much flexibility to deal with different traffic types or affiliations. Cloud Computing, however, demands policy enforcement on a per-Provider, per-Service and/or per-Tenant basis. In addition, there is an increasing need for dynamic transparent network chaining independent of the underlying transport infrastructure. We first introduce the concept of Universal Cloud Classification as a Service (UCCaaS). Followed by highlighting how it can be leveraged in conjunction with Network Service Headers (NSH) to address above challenges. UCC provides an addressing scheme to isolate traffic streams on a per-provider, per-service and/or per-tenant basis. To enable bi-directional policy enforcement in network functions we extend the UCC proposal by adding source and destination support. NSH is a way to steer network traffic dynamically across a set of network functions. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of our UCCaaS + NSH proposal with an example application, where a service chain defines Access Control Lists and traffic rate limiting on a per-Service and per-Tenant basis. Our proposal opens a door for a wide range of cloud-aware network services and functions.","2159-6190","978-1-5090-2619-7","10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820308","Cloud Computing;SDN;Controller;Classification;XaaS;Universal Cloud Classification;Service Function Chain","Cloud computing;Proposals;Metadata;Security;Vehicle dynamics;Routing","","","4","20","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a cloud-native environment, different jobs have different resource requirements and execution times, causing the efficiency of job scheduling to affect system performance. Therefore, job scheduling algorithms have to face several issues: 1. resource contention resulting from insufficient resource allocation to task groups in decentralized approaches, such as Apache Spark. 2. heterogeneous resource requirements of different jobs running in one computing node. 3. Communication overhead arising from parallel job execution. Therefore, this work proposes a workflow scheduling approach in cloud-native environments. The proposed approach is named as the Heterogeneous Workflow Scheduling Algorithm (HWS), which is a novel solution designed to tackle the complexities associated with task scheduling in cloud-native big data environments. HWS addresses the above issues to avoid the resource contention in group dependencies, and reduce the job execution time and the communication overhead. The proposed approach consists of two primary components: the job priority evaluation module and the job assignment module. Experimental results show that HWS outperforms two heuristic-based workflow scheduling algorithms, MPEFT and IPPTS, with improvements of 11.4% and 11.3% over MPEFT and IPPTS, respectively.","2768-4156","979-8-3503-9492-4","10.1109/ICASI60819.2024.10547825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10547825","Workflow;Job Scheduling;Cloud Native;Container","Technological innovation;Scheduling algorithms;System performance;Simulation;Data transfer;Scheduling;Complexity theory","","","","7","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in a tactical network in which the network topology changes, the current edge computing technology has difficulty in satisfying the functions required for service continuity according to network mobility.

In our system, reusable application components are assembled on the cloud in different logical chains and the client is solely concerned with how data is displayed and gathered from users. In this way, the chaining of requests and responses is done by the cloud and the client side has no knowledge of the application logic.

First, we examine the impact of distance-adaptive modulation formats on network performance. Second, we analyze how the optimization of a particular criterion influences other performance metrics. Finally, wefocuson the benefitsof using anycasting instead of typical unicast transmission in EONs. The results show that the use of multiple modulation formats instead of one selected format can bring significant savings in terms of all performance metrics (up to 40% for spectrum usage).","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.6.000816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924120","Cloud computing;Distance-adaptive modulation formats;Elastic optical network;Optimization","Modulation;Optical fiber networks;Unicast;Resource management;Optimization;Power demand;Measurement","","12","","40","","15 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Are Clouds Ready to Accelerate Ad Hoc Financial Simulations?","B. Varghese; A.

Many of these simulations are routinely performed on production-based computing systems. Ad hoc simulations in addition to routine simulations are required to obtain up-to-date views of risk metrics. Such simulations are currently not performed as they cannot be accommodated on production clusters, which are typically over committed resources. Scalable, on-demand and pay-as-you go Virtual Machines (VMs) offered by the cloud are a potential platform to satisfy the data, memory and computational constraints of the simulation. However, ""Are clouds ready to accelerate ad hoc financial simulations?"" The research reported in this paper aims to experimentally verify this question by developing and deploying an important financial simulation, referred to as 'Aggregate Risk Analysis' on the cloud. Parallel techniques to improve efficiency and performance of the simulations are explored. Challenges such as accommodating large input data on limited memory VMs and rapidly processing data for real-time use are surmounted. The key result of this investigation is that Aggregate Risk Analysis can be accommodated on cloud VMs. Acceleration of up to 24x using multiple hardware accelerators over the implementation on a single accelerator, 6x over a multiple core implementation and approximately 60x over a baseline implementation was achieved on the cloud. However, computational time is wasted for every dollar spent on the cloud due to poor acceleration over multiple virtual cores. Interestingly, private VMs can offer better performance than public VMs on comparable underlying hardware.","","978-1-4799-1897-3","10.1109/BDC.2014.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321729","cloud computing;heterogeneous computing;Aggregate Risk Analysis;financial risk;risk simulation","Aggregates;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Graphics processing units;Risk analysis;Memory management;Hardware","","1","","25","IEEE","9 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development of cloud-native databases reveals three trends. One is the adoption of multi-datacenter (DC) deployment to survive the downtime of any single site. Another is the separation of computation and storage resources to achieve higher elasticity and scalability. The last is the support of HTAP to eliminate data redundancy and system complexity from heterogeneous databases. To cater to these trends, we design a distributed relational database called PolarDB-X, which is built on top of the cloud-native database PolarDB. It hence inherits many cloud-native features, such as multi-datacenter deployment and elasticity. To achieve cross-DC capability, it leverages Paxos and hybrid logical clock to achieve durability and snapshot-isolation consistency with low coordination costs. For resource elasticity, since the underlying PolarDB supports rapid migration of tenants between nodes, PolarDB-X can quickly scale the cluster to cope with a sudden traffic increase. For HTAP support, with the help of read replicas and a HTAP executor, PolarDB-X can improve the latency and parallelism of analytical queries without impacting concurrently-running TP workloads. Using its MPP engine and an in-memory column index, the efficiency of analytical queries can be further enhanced. PolarDB-X is now a cloud database service at Alibaba Cloud.

However, a non-negligible feature of today's software applications is the ease of portability between heterogeneous distributed computing clusters, dedicated high-performance computing (HPC) facilities, and public/private computing clouds. This need exists in several contexts, particularly in ocean forecasting. For example, assessing adverse impacts on overall ocean activities requires an accurate prediction of ocean pollution. We propose a new paradigm using a cloud-native approach for cloud-based scalable high-performance computing and define high-performance cloud-native computing (HPCNC). The proposed paradigm's architecture is supported by evaluating the performance of WaComM++ (Water quality Community Model Plus-Plus), a decision-making tool for Lagrangian inert transport and diffusion. This work introduces a new paradigm for computational marine environmental research: High-Performance Cloud-Native Computing (HPCNC). The proposed approach aims to democratize data science, numerical simulation, and AI-based prediction by leveraging cloud and local resources. We show that HPCNC brings tremendous benefits, not only in terms of the performance already achieved by using HPC but also in terms of significant savings in the resources used. The methodology presented here leverages containerization to scale computational resources. The scaling operation is lightweight by implementing a new HPC approach defined as computational power and I/O malleability. Finally, this paper presents our preliminary but encouraging results applying the HPCNC paradigm to the WaComM++ model.

Metadata is control data of KubeEdge and transmitted massively between cloud and edge when microservice based application is deployed to edge and deletion from edge. However, KubeEdge currently lacks of optimization to deployment and deletion of microservice based application, resulting in high cloud-edge metadata traffic. In this paper, we propose KubeMSEN, extending KubeEdge to support metadata sharing among edge nodes. We firstly use distributed Raft election algorithm to elect leader among edge nodes. Then leader is responsile for sharing metadata among edge nodes to reduce cloud-edge metadata traffic. KubeMSEN is completely cloud-native and relatively simple, only have one additional module based on KubeEdge. KubeMSEN can be also implemented based on other cloud-native platform such as Kubernetes and Openyurt. We tested KubeMSEN in real KubeEdge cluster, and the experimental results show that KubeMSEN can effectively reduce cloud-edge metadata traffic of application deployment and deletion by 33% and 42% respectively compared with native KubeEdge.","","979-8-3503-0903-4","10.1109/ICFTIC59930.2023.10456315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10456315","KubeEdge;cloud-native;edge computing;metadata;data sharing","Measurement;Costs;Heart beat;Voting;Microservice architectures;Metadata;Containers","","","","13","IEEE","13 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, the utilization of these by the mobile user equipment (UE) having limited battery lifetime is quite a challenge. To cope with this problem, the mobile cloud computing can be exploited to offload high complex applications to the cloud. Nevertheless, the conventional mobile cloud solution introduces high delay and limits the use of delay sensitive services and applications. One feasible solution is to enhance small cells (SCeNBs) with computing capabilities and, thus, perform computing closer to the users accomplishing low delay. However, the high density deployment of the SCeNBs and UEs' mobility can result in often outage situation or handover when low delay tolerant data cannot be delivered from the cloud on time and become irrelevant. In this paper we propose power control algorithm, which purpose is to guarantee that the requests processed by the small cell cloud are received by the UE within required delay. This is done by coarse and dynamic fine setting of the SCeNB's transmitting power level. The simulations demonstrate the amount of undelivered requests from the small cell cloud can be significantly minimized when compared to competitive schemes. At the same time, QoS of non-cloud users is only slightly impaired when compared to the scheme giving solely preferences to non-cloud users. We also show that the overhead introduced by our power control mechanism is negligible.","2166-0077","978-1-4799-7470-2","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063570","power control;small cells;mobile cloud computing;small cell cloud","Interference;Power control;Signal to noise ratio;Mobile communication;Delays;Proposals;Handover","","12","","15","IEEE","19 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fault handling mechanisms provided by BPEL are well suited for handling faults of the business logic, but infrastructure-induced errors should be handled automatically to avoid over-complication of workflow design and keep concerns separated. This paper identifies classes of faults that can be resolved automatically by the infrastructure, and provides a policy-based approach to configure this automatic behavior without the need for adding explicit fault handling mechanisms to the BPEL process. The proposed approach provides automatic redundancy of services using a Cloud infrastructure to allow substitution of defective services.

However, recent adoption of Cloud-based scientific workflows present an opportunity to investigate the suitability of existing approaches or propose new approaches to collect provenance information from the Cloud and to utilize it for workflow repeatability in the Cloud infrastructure. The dynamic nature of the Cloud in comparison to the Grid makes it difficult because resources are provisioned on-demand unlike the Grid. This paper presents a novel approach that can assist in mitigating this challenge. This approach can collect Cloud infrastructure information along with workflow provenance and can establish a mapping between them. This mapping is later used to re-provision resources on the Cloud. The repeatability of the workflow execution is performed by: (a) capturing the Cloud infrastructure information (virtual machine configuration) along with the workflow provenance, and (b) re-provisioning the similar resources on the Cloud and re-executing the workflow on them. The evaluation of an initial prototype suggests that the proposed approach is feasible and can be investigated further.","","978-1-4799-7881-6","10.1109/UCC.2014.155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027622","Cloud computing;Provenance;Repeatability;Scientific Workflows","Clouds;Prototypes;Databases;Virtual machining;Communities;Random access memory;Cloud computing","","1","","41","IEEE","2 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, “fog computing” is emerging, bringing the cloud toward the edge, near the end user, in order to increase privacy, improve resource efficiency, and reduce latency. Combining these two trends, however, proves difficult because of four fundamental disconnects between the cloud native paradigm and fog computing. This article identifies these disconnects and proposes a fog native architecture along with a set of design patterns to take full advantage of the fog. Central to this approach is turning microservice applications into microservice workflows, constructed dynamically by the system using an intent-based approach taking into account a number of factors such as user requirements, request location, and available infrastructure and microservices. The architecture introduces a novel softwarized fog mesh facilitating both inter-microservice connectivity, external communication, and end-user aggregation. Our evaluation analyzes the impact of distributing microservice-based applications over a fog ecosystem, illustrating the impact of CPU and network latency and application metrics on perceived quality of service of fog native workflows compared to the cloud.

We present Ursa, a lightweight resource management system for cloud-native microservices that addresses these challenges. Ursa uses an analytical model that decomposes the end-to-end SLA into per-service SLA, and maps per-service SLA to individual resource allocations per microservice tier. To speed up the exploration process and avoid prolonged SLA violations, Ursa explores each microservice individually, and swiftly stops exploration if latency exceeds its SLA. We evaluate Ursa on a set of representative and end-to-end microservice topologies, including a social network, media service and video processing pipeline, each consisting of multiple classes and priorities of requests with different SLAs, and compare it against two representative ML-driven systems, Sinan and Firm. Compared to these ML-driven approaches, Ursa provides significant advantages: It shortens the data collection process by more than 128 ×, and its control plane is 43 × faster than ML-driven approaches. At the same time, Ursa does not sacrifice resource efficiency or SLAs.

Performing benchmarks has proven to be a time-consuming and error-prone task, especially when executing multiple consecutive tests on the same system. This sparked curiosity in exploring the feasibility of automating this manual benchmarking process. This paper proposes Cloud-NativeBench (CNB), a novel open source benchmarking framework implemented as a Kubernetes operator that fully automates the benchmarking cycle. The entire process, including benchmark deployment, the consecutive execution of benchmarks in a queue, results collection, and statistical data analysis, is fully automated. The framework is designed to be extensible without the need to adapt the operator itself, enabling users to develop fine-tuned custom benchmarks according to their specific use cases. A detailed evaluation shows the ease-of-use of Cloud-Native-Bench and how it streamlines the process of running benchmarks in cloud-native environments.

In this paper, we consider all-optical multicast in EONs in a practical manner and focus on designing impairment- and splitting-aware multicast provisioning schemes. We first study the procedure of adaptive modulation selection for a light-tree, and point out that the multicast scheme in EONs is fundamentally different from that in the fixed-grid wavelength-division multiplexing networks. Then, we formulate the problem of impairment- and splitting-aware routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (ISa-RMSA) for all-optical multicast in EONs and analyze its hardness. Next, we analyze the advantages brought by the flexibility of routing structures and discuss the ISa-RMSA schemes based on light-trees and light-forests. This paper suggests that for ISa-RMSA, the light-forest-based approach can use less bandwidth than the light-tree-based one, while still satisfying the quality of transmission requirement. Therefore, we establish the minimum light-forest problem for optimizing a light-forest in ISa-RMSA. Finally, we design several time-efficient ISa-RMSA algorithms, and prove that one of them can solve the minimum light-forest problem with a fixed approximation ratio.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2615942","NSFC Project(grant numbers:61371117); Natural Science Research Project for Universities in Anhui(grant numbers:KJ2014ZD38); Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS(grant numbers:XDA06011202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7731159","Elastic optical networks (EONs);all-optical multicast;routing;modulation and spectrum assignments (RMSA);impairment;approximation algorithm","Optical switches;Bandwidth;Routing;Optical fiber networks;Modulation;WDM networks;Algorithm design and analysis","","51","","45","IEEE","2 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increase in demand for, and complexity of applications, the composition process becomes an arduous task often associated with errors and a suboptimal use of computer resources. To alleviate such a process, we introduce an approach that uses planning to automatically and dynamically compose applications ready for Cloud deployment. The industry may benefit from using automated planning in terms of support for product variability, sophisticated search in large spaces, fault tolerance, near-optimal deployment plans, etc. Our approach is based on Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning as it supports rich domain knowledge, component modularity, hierarchical representation of causality, and speed of computation. We describe a deployment using a formal component model for the Cloud, and we propose a way to define and solve an HTN planning problem from the deployment one. We employ an existing HTN planner to experimentally evaluate the feasibility of our approach.","","978-1-5386-1326-9","10.1109/SOCA.2017.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241528","service composition;automated planning;application configuration;software deployment;cloud computing","Planning;Cloud computing;Buildings;Ports (Computers)","","9","","27","IEEE","1 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the vast number of video stream formats (e.g., MP4, FLV) and transmission protocols (e.g., HTTP, RTMP, RTSP) for supporting varying types of playback terminals (particularly mobile devices such as iphone/ipad and Android phones), video content providers often need to transcode videos to multiple formats in order to stream to different types of users. Being time-sensitive and requiring high bandwidth, video streaming exerts high pressure on underlying delivery networks. Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers can help their customers quickly and reliably distribute stream contents to end users. In addition to distributing video streams, CDN providers typically allow their customers to perform video transcoding on CDN platforms. With the high volume of video streams and the bursty transcoding workload, CDN providers are eager to deploy elastic and optimized cloud-based transcoding platforms.

The results of the simulations show that the proposed CG method performs very good (average gap to optimal result was at most 2.1%), wherein its efficiency depends on the method used to calculate initial set of columns.

However, evaluating the performance of elasticity in cloud-native platforms is not a trivial task. These platforms tend to focus on providing higher abstractions to their customers, which typically results in the absence of low-level metrics that are required for measuring and evaluating elasticity performance. Therefore, this paper presents SABER, an infrastructure-agnostic benchmark tool for elasticity evaluation of Cloud Foundry based platforms.

As a gateway, the access layer provides clients with data conversion and routing. The logical layer is split into several independent microservices that are deployed in the cloud in a containerized manner. The data layer provides a unified interface, shielding the storage layer from implementation details. The storage layer stores data. This paper also proposes a method for building a message service, including a message ID generation algorithm that generates locally incremental message sequence numbers in the user namespace to ensure the uniqueness and orderliness of messages and uses optimization strategies such as allocator batch fetching and double buffering to improve the availability of the system.

When deploying their services, service providers need to specify a proper amount of resources to K8s, so that the desired Quality of Service (QoS) to their users can be maintained. To cope with the varying traffic demand coming from users, they can rely on the K8s Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) mechanism. To ensure that enough resources are available when needed, the standard HPA mechanism relies on resource overprovisioning. In this way, the required QoS is achieved most of (or all) the time but at the expense of additional resources that are allocated (and charged for), while they may stay idle for significant periods of time. A way to reduce overprovisioning is provided by the soft resource isolation of K8s, which allows services to compensate for a temporary lack of resources with shared resources, i.e., idle resources of the machines where services are running. However, during traffic spikes, these idle resources may not be enough to serve the whole demand, degrading the QoS. The HPA, which is not aware of how much demand could not be served, is not always able to correctly estimate the required additional resources, further degrading the QoS. To overcome this, service providers need to leverage overprovisioning, limiting the use of shared resources. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for autoscaling resources in K8s that relies on service-related data to avoid the additional degradation introduced by the HPA. The proposed strategy also offers a way to tune overprovisioning and shared resources. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce idle resources by up to 60% compared with the HPA mechanism.","2575-4912","979-8-3503-1102-0","10.1109/EuCNC/6GSummit58263.2023.10188268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10188268","Cloud native services;QoS;service degradation;Pod autoscaling;Kubernetes;Shared resources;Pod as a Service","Degradation;6G mobile communication;Limiting;Simulation;Quality of service;Containers;Planning","","","","12","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the computation and energy resource limitation severely hinders its development and application. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) emerges as a promising platform to process the tasks offloaded from the UAVs to effectively improve the Quality-of-Service (QoS). To this vision, it is first required that the edge servers must be deployed with the needed service to handle the offloaded task. Fortunately, by exploring cloud native computing technology, it is possible to deploy container-based microservice to MEC in a prompt way. In this case, it raises the task scheduling problem on whether to deploy a new service or to utilize an existing service to balance the overhead between data transmission and the microservice deployment (i.e., container image pulling) for overall task completion time minimization. In this paper, the problem is first formulated in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) form, and proved to be NP-hard. We further propose an incentive-based request scheduling algorithm. Experiments based on track-driven simulations show that the total completion time for all tasks is reduced by 21.37% compared to the state-of-the-art solution.","","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001252","","Multi-access edge computing;Scheduling algorithms;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Containers;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Data communication","","3","","18","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High availability of mission and business critical applications is a necessity as any downtime or poor performance can have a negative impact on the revenue and operations of the organization. Applications transitioning to cloud are adopting modular design and distributed system architecture. As a result, the system complexity and the number of failure points have increased. One of the promises of cloud platforms is high availability by building redundancy in the application architecture. However, enterprises opting for cloud often struggle to define the right framework for high availability. In addition, even after redundancy is built at the application layer, building a similar redundant and resilient architecture at the database layer is challenging. For near zero downtime experience, applications should be able to perform automated application and database failover with minimum manual intervention. This could be a valuable feature for applications that are expected to be available 24/7. In this paper we will define a cloud native template architecture that enterprise applications can incorporate to be highly available and evaluate techniques to perform automatic database failover for a near zero downtime experience. We will then incorporate the database failover technique as part of the recommended application architecture to review the impact during planned maintenance activities and outages.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3303430","Shared Platforms and Product Organization, part of Network Systems in Verizon; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214005","Cloud computing;database failover;high availability;zero downtime","Databases;Redundancy;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Network systems;Microservice architectures;Maintenance engineering","","2","","34","CCBYNCND","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of these mission-critical services is Back Situation Awareness (BSA) that supports Emergency Vehicles (EmVs) by increasing awareness about them on the roads. In this article, we introduce an on-demand BSA application service, which has been developed for multi-domain Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) systems, enabling early notification for vehicles on the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of an approaching EmV. The state-of-the-art approaches inform civilian vehicles about EmVs only when they are in a close proximity (up to 300 m). However, in some situations (e.g., in congested areas), this may not be enough for the civilian vehicles to safely and timely maneuver out of the lane of an EmV. Our approach is, to the best of our knowledge, a unique way to significantly extend this awareness by creating an orchestrated 5G-based MEC deployment of BSA application service on optimally selected edges, thereby stretching over multiple edge domains and even countries. While consuming the real-time location, speed, and heading of an EmV, such application service affords the drivers with sufficient time to create a clear corridor, allowing the EmV to pass through unhindered in a safe manner thereby increasing the mission success. The detailed design and the performance analysis of the BSA application service that has been created following modern cloud-native principles based on Docker and Kubernetes, is presented in terms of the impact of emergency scale on the MEC system resources and service response time. Moreover, we also introduce a metric called panic indicator, which depicts how the proposed BSA service can potentially help in enabling drivers to calmly maneuver out of the path of an EmV, thereby increasing road safety.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3304172","H2020 projects 5G-CARMEN(grant numbers:825012); 5G-BLUEPRINT(grant numbers:952189); Flemish Ministry of Mobility and Public Works; Agency for Roads and Traffic; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214359","MEC;5G;multi-domain back situation awareness;NFV orchestration;vehicular communications;public safety","Time factors;Vehicles;5G mobile communication;Medical services;Road safety;Real-time systems;Quality of service","","2","","42","IEEE","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, CNF may introduce new security concerns (e.g., data exfiltration and ransomware) due to potential code injection attacks against network functions at runtime. This will potentially result in a breach of functional integrity of these network functions. Towards verifying such functional integrity breaches of CNFs at the 5G-operator-level, existing approaches fell short, as most of them either (i) perform pre-deployment verification (i.e., verifying the CNF image before the deployment) and hence fail to verify integrity breaches occurring after the deployment, or (ii) perform post-deployment verification (i.e., verifying against attack signatures or normal behavior patterns) approaches that require provider-level data (e.g., system calls) which is usually inaccessible to 5G operators. In this paper, we propose 5GFIVer, a new operator-oriented approach for functional integrity verification of CNFs that overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. First, our approach utilizes the side-channel information such as performance metrics (which are already available at the operator level) so that no provider-level data is needed. Second, our approach implements unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect outliers through time-series analysis of those available performance metrics, and hence no instrumentation for the data collection as well as no training data is required. Third, we leverage the correlation between multiple CNFs to improve the accuracy and minimize false positives (e.g., caused by cloud dynamics). Our experimental results under an open source 5G testbed demonstrate the effectiveness and negligible overhead of our solution.","2330-2186","978-1-6654-6367-6","10.1109/CloudCom55334.2022.00032","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005426","Virtualization;Softwarization;5G;Container;Cloud;Network;Security","Measurement;Cloud computing;Runtime;Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Time series analysis;Training data","","1","","41","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards combating these issues, we design, develop, and evaluate our platform for Energy Efficient Latency-Aware Scheduling (EELAS) of workloads.

When containers run inside virtual machines (VMs) to protect infrastructural assets, network policies (NPs) at the container layer and security groups (SGs) at the VM layer provide complementary firewall mechanisms that strengthen defenses against lateral movement of attackers. However, least-privilege NPs at the container layer may not always be consistent with statically defined, over-permissive SGs at the VM layer. This is especially a problem with low-latency configuration of container networking solutions that requires every opened container protocol, port and traffic direction also to be opened at the VM layer. In any post-exploitation scenario where attackers escape from within an already compromised or infected container, such over-permissive SGs do not prevent the attacker from spreading across VMs to find powerful tokens for accessing the cluster orchestrator. In this paper, we introduce GrassHopper (GH), a fast and dynamic cross-layer enforcement approach for NPs, which automatically generates SG configurations from dynamically verified NPs. Given the low-latency context, the design of GH must ensure that dynamically generated SG rules are applied fast before the newly scheduled containers become ready to serve traffic. We evaluate GH on a Kubernetes cluster running on OpenStack. For a wide range of relevant low-latency applications and cluster setups, GH can reduce the network attack surface between VMs at a ratio of 75-to-99% while causing no application level performance overhead with respect to latency, throughput, and CPU utilization.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-0481-7","10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254996","container orchestration;kubernetes;network isolation;network policies;security groups","Measurement;Cloud computing;Cross layer design;Protocols;Firewalls (computing);Containers;Throughput","","1","","55","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We find subsecond processing latency and linear but heavily task-dependent scaling behavior in the other performance indicators’ case.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-7716-1","10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154377","Kafka;Kafka Streams;stream processing;performance analysis;IoT","Cloud computing;Key performance indicator;Throughput;Real-time systems;Performance analysis;Internet of Things;Task analysis","","","","29","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To that end, we present DLCache, a cloud-native dataset management and runtime-aware data-loading solution for deep learning training jobs. DLCache supports the low-latency and high-throughput I/O requirements of DL training jobs using cloud buckets as persistent data storage and a dedicated computation cluster for training. DLCache comprises four layers: a control plane, a metadata plane, an operator plane, and a multi-tier storage plane, which are seamlessly integrated with the Kubernetes ecosystem thereby providing ease of deployment, scalability, and self-healing. For efficient memory utilization, DLCache is designed with an on-the-fly and best-effort caching mechanism that can auto-scale the cache according to runtime configurations, resource constraints, and training speeds. DLCache considers both frequency and freshness of data access as well as data preparation costs in making effective cache eviction decisions that result in reduced completion time for deep learning workloads. Results of evaluating DLCache on the Imagenet-ILSVRC and LibriSpeech datasets under various runtime configurations and simulated GPU computation time experiments showed up to a 147.49% and 156.67% improvement in data loading throughput, respectively, compared to the popular PyTorch framework.","2770-162X","979-8-3503-3902-4","10.1109/ISORC58943.2023.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196902","Deep Learning Training;Cache System;Cloudnative;Data Management;System Software","Deep learning;Training;Time-frequency analysis;Runtime;Systematics;Loading;Graphics processing units","","","","24","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commercial gaming providers, e.g., Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, etc., hardly disclose any information on how they optimize gaming performance and cloud cost. In this work, we aim to investigate resource cost optimization for such cloud gaming systems. In contrast to previous work which have been focusing more on theoretical approaches, we deliver a fully functional, cost-optimized cloud-native gaming system, called CloudNPlay, implemented entirely on AWS Lambda, EC2 and other AWS services. We have conducted extensive evaluations on the gaming performance including latency and frame rates; as well as cloud resource cost reduction. The results indicate that games hosted on CloudNPlay are highly playable. More importantly, CloudNPlay reduces the resource cost by around 24% compared to a non-optimized deployment.

This is due to their potential in enabling innovative services and delivering unparalleled performance. To meet these expectations, mobile network operators (MNOs) are investing in cloud native technologies to enhance the reliability, delivery, and adaptability of their services. Consequently, network infrastructures are growing in complexity, particularly with regard to the integration of computing, caching, and communications resources. Managing such complex infrastructure requires novel paradigms that can lower operational costs and enable autonomous management. One promising paradigm for achieving such goals is intent-based networking (IBN). By introducing the notion of intent, IBN empowers systems to autonomously fulfill high-level specified expectations. It emphasizes on the desired outcome rather than the technical details, which proves to be efficient in tackling the escalating network complexity. In this article, we introduce an intent-driven system that translates high-level service demands expressed in a natural language and transforms them into continuously monitored deployments. The proposed system incorporates a closed automation loop that continuously monitors and fulfills the desired expectations. It provides multi-access edge computing (MEC) digital services and 5G core network functions' resources.

It's worth noting that although Kubernetes clusters can include Windows nodes running Windows containers, most of the hardening options available are specific to Linux containers. Kubernetes provides a number of features that can be used, when applications are being deployed to the cluster, to improve their security. Security contexts can either be set at the level of a container or apply to all containers in a pod. Dropping capabilities can be an effective method of hardening a container and reducing the risk that an attacker can break out to attack other applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.

Several existing 5G-Telecom network products such as element Management System (e-MS), 5G-Core and 5G-Access are being redesigned to fit the microservice paradigm. Cloud environment allows enterprises to scale their application on-demand with minimum cost; however, it is often difficult to use containers without sacrificing many benefits that cloud-native technology offers. The e-MS is characterized to orchestrate 5G network elements (5GNEs) deployed nationwide, and systematically store terabytes of stateful data per second. Containers are characterized to have an ephemeral state, hence ‘stateful-ness’ aspect of e-MS makes orchestration complex. In this paper, different challenges around stateful storage selection, content placement and content retrieval operations within e-MS microservices are described. To overcome these challenges, to this end, we propose CASE - A Context-Aware Storage placement and retrieval Ecosystem - which enables context-based operations to be intrinsically supported by the underlying e-MS application. Our approach has been designed to maintain the location-independent philosophy of cloud-native by associating context information directly to 5GNE rather than fixed storage entities, thereby ensuring scalability. Through simulation with real data-set obtained from one of the world’s largest terrestrial telecom operator, we show that based on such location-independent context information, CASE with e-MS can facilitate high performance despite dynamic 5GNE count agility, stateless e-MS replication and stateful storage scaling, while not posing a significant signaling burden on the cloud environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3139339","Samsung R&D Institute India, Bangalore (SRIB); Samsung Electronics, HQ, Suwon; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665739","5G networks;cloud native;microservices;containers;context-aware services;communication networks and telecommunication network topology","Microservice architectures;5G mobile communication;Containers;Computer aided software engineering;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Ecosystems","","2","","22","CCBY","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fine-granular resource management guarantees better computing resource usage, which is critical to reducing energy consumption and resource wastage (vital in edge computing). In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-touch management (ZSM) framework featuring a fine-granular computing resource scaler in a cloud-native environment. The proposed scaler algorithm uses Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models to predict microservice performances; if a service degradation is detected, then a root-cause analysis is conducted using eXplainable AI (XAI). Based on the XAI output, the proposed framework scales only the needed (exact amount) resources (i.e., CPU or memory) to overcome the service degradation. The proposed framework and resource scheduler have been implemented on top of a cloud-native platform based on the well-known Kubernetes tool. The obtained results clearly indicate that the proposed scheduler with lesser resources achieves the same service quality as the default scheduler of Kubernetes.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175438","AC3; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175438","Zero-touch Service Management (ZSM);Cloud-native;Containerized Microservices;Machine Learning;Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Degradation;Energy consumption;Memory management;Microservice architectures;Learning (artificial intelligence);Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","1","","16","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such cloud-based mobile networks, ensuring service resilience is an important challenge to tackle. Indeed, high availability and service reliability are important requirements of carrier grade, but not necessarily intrinsic features of cloud computing. Building a system that requires the five nines reliability on a platform that may not always grant it is, therefore, a hurdle. Effectively, in carrier cloud, service resilience can be heavily impacted by a failure of any network function (NF) running on a virtual machine (VM). In this paper, we introduce a framework, along with efficient and proactive restoration mechanisms, to ensure service resilience in carrier cloud. As restoration of a NF failure impacts a potential number of users, adequate network overload control mechanisms are also proposed. A mathematical model is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanisms. The obtained results are encouraging and demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms efficiently achieve their design goals.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2525342","TAKE 5 project; Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (TEKES); Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397878","5G;carrier cloud;cloud;Markov process;network function virtualization (NFV);network softwarization;network virtualization;resilience;social network","Mobile communication;Cloud computing;Mobile computing;Hardware;Resilience;Reliability","","73","4","35","IEEE","3 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the introduction of the virtualization layer and the decoupling of the network functions and their running infrastructure, the operation models need to include new elements like virtual network functions (VNFs) and a new set of relationships between them and the NFV Infrastructure (NFVI). The NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework plays the key role in managing and orchestrating the NFV infrastructure, network services and the associated VNFs. Failures of the MANO hinders the network ability to react to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services. Thus, it becomes extremely important to ensure a high level of availability for the MANO architecture. The goal of this work is to model, analyze, and evaluate the impact that different failure modes have on the MANO availability. A model based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), derived from current standard-compliant microservice-based implementations, is proposed as a case study. The case study is used to quantitatively evaluate the steady-state availability and identify the most important parameters influencing the system availability for different deployment configurations.","","978-1-7281-6300-0","10.1109/DRCN48652.2020.1570604378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089340","NFV-MANO;OSM;Availability;SAN models;Docker","Software;Computer architecture;Aging;Logic gates;Reliability engineering;Communication networks","","8","","26","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this systems integration study, we develop and evaluate the novel XDP-Monitoring Energy-Adaptive Network Functions (X-MAN) framework for managing the CPU operational states (P-states) so as to reduce the power consumption while prioritizing low-latency service. Architecturally, X-MAN consists of lightweight traffic monitors that are attached to the virtual network interfaces in the kernel space for per-CNF traffic monitoring and a power manager in user space with a global view of the CNFs on a CPU core. Algorithmically, X-MAN monitors the CPU core utilization via hybrid simple and weighted moving average prediction fed by the traffic monitors and a power management based on step-based CPU core frequency (P-state) adjustments. We evaluate X-MAN through extensive measurements in a real physical testbed operating at up to 10 Gbps. We find that X-MAN incurs significantly shorter and more consistent monitoring latencies for the CPU utilization than a state-of-the-art CPU hardware counter approach.

Thus, much attention has been focused on determining how to avoid the uncontrollable cloud security induced by complex production relations and non-trustworthy software/hardware sources when the two sets of security risks intersect. In this article, we investigate latent persistent threats against cloud environments and determine a high degree of complementarity and consistency between the NFV-based cloud environment and the dynamic defense concept. More specifically, new NFV-based cloud features provide an effective implementation for dynamic defense, while the generalized robustness of dynamic defense theory allows for high security gains. Intrinsic cloud security (iCS) is then proposed to align NFV-based clouds, mimicking defense and the moving target defense (MTD) paradigm to implement a seamless integration and symbiosis evolution between security and NFV-based clouds.

The use of well-defined standards is critical to a robust security implementation. This design focuses on the use of JSON Web Token (JWT) which is an open standard established in RFC7519. The JWT tokens are distributed using the OpenID Connect protocol which is maintained by the OpenID Foundation. OpenID Connect hosted by a Single-Sign-On provider allows a single login to access multiple microservices. Finally, Infrastructure can be further protected by defining strong software communication rules. Any software/service that is not expected to connect to a microservice can be explicitly denied access by specifically defining rules as to what can talk to what. Istio is discussed as a technology to enforce these rules.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438218","","Resistance;Satellites;Protocols;Conferences;Computer architecture;Data processing;Software","","2","","18","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Front-end code is included in this architecture by using server-side rendering of JS bundles. Environments for integration testing are created with preproduction deploys side by side with production deploys using appropriate levels of isolation. After a successful integration test run, preproduction components are known to work with production precisely as it is. For isolation, test traffic uses staging databases that are copied daily from the production databases, omitting sensitive data.

Unfortunately, most of the current SLO management solutions rely on reactive approaches, i.e., correcting SLO violations only after they have occurred. Further, the few methods that explore predictive techniques to prevent SLO violations focus solely on forecasting low-level system metrics, such as CPU and Memory utilization. Although valid in some cases, these metrics do not necessarily provide clear and actionable insights into application behavior. This paper presents a novel approach that directly predicts high-level SLOs using low-level system metrics. We target this goal by training and optimizing two state-of-the-art neural network models, a Short-Term Long Memory - LSTM, and a Transformer-based model. Our models provide actionable insights into application behavior by establishing proper connections between the evolution of low-level workload-related metrics and the high-level SLOs. We demonstrate our approach to selecting and preparing the data. We show in practice how to optimize LSTM and Transformer by targeting efficiency as a high-level SLO metric and performing a comparative analysis. We show how these models behave when the input workloads come from different distributions. Consequently, we demonstrate their ability to generalize in heterogeneous systems. Finally, we operationalize our two models by integrating them into the Polaris framework we have been developing to enable a performance-driven SLO-native approach to Cloud computing.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-0481-7","10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10255023","workload prediction;neural networks;cloud;LSTM;Transformers","Measurement;Cloud computing;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Predictive models;Transformers","","1","","39","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

State-of-the-art algorithms for automated orchestration and management tend to rely on data-driven methods which require a timely and accurate view of the network. Accurately monitoring an end-to-end (E2E) network slice requires a scalable monitoring architecture that facilitates collection and correlation of data from various network segments comprising the slice. The state-of-the-art on 5G monitoring mostly focuses on scalability, falling short in providing explicit support for network slicing and computing network slice key performance indicators (KPIs). To fill this gap, in this paper, we present MonArch, a scalable monitoring architecture for 5G, which focuses on network slice monitoring, slice KPI computation, and an application programming interface (API) for specifying slice monitoring requests. We validate the proposed architecture by implementing MonArch on a 5G testbed, and demonstrate its capability to compute a network slice KPI (e.g., slice throughput). Our evaluations show that MonArch does not significantly increase data ingestion time when scaling the number of slices and that a 5-second monitoring interval offers a good balance between monitoring overhead and accuracy.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-7716-1","10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154344","Mitacs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154344","Network Slicing;KPI;Monitoring;5G Network","Correlation;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Network slicing;Key performance indicator;Decision making;Computer architecture","","1","","15","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This variability mandates swift and responsive resource adjustments to mitigate the risk of incurring unnecessary costs during off-peak periods, where a significant fraction of nodes may be under-utilized. Tackling this challenge is integral to optimizing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of telco edge DCs. To this end, this article aims to address the Dynamic Data Center Sizing (DDS) problem, which boils down to optimizing the number of active nodes as per current resource demand. The proposed DDS solution consists of two core modules, namely a forecasting module, which predicts resource demands, and a decision-making module, which acts upon predicted demands. The decision-making of DDS is implemented via the filtering and the rank-drain-observe (RDO) algorithms. Filtering is based on integer linear programming, and it computes the theoretically optimal state of the DC based on predicted resource demands. RDO is a heuristic that strives to realize the optimal DC state in an iterative and robust fashion. To expedite RDO in large-scale clusters, we further devise a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-enabled DDS variant (i.e., RL-DDS), in which RDO integrates an RL agent that computes optimized batches of nodes for concurrent deactivation. We propose an innovative solution based on the notion of Digital Twin to train the RL agent in emulation mode. DDS and RL-DDS are evaluated upon real-life testbeds resembling actual DCs. Results demonstrate significant cost reduction, ranging from 7% in conservative and relatively static scenarios, up to 38% in highly dynamic settings.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3421289","European Union-NextGenerationEU Program under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan “Greece 2.0” Framework through the ARCADIA Project(grant numbers:T2EDK-02097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10577967","Data center management;resource allocation;network function virtualization;reinforcement learning;digital twin","Decision making;Filtering;Data centers;Network function virtualization;Resource management;Reinforcement learning;Prediction algorithms","","","","29","CCBYNCND","1 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, these probe deployment patterns have not been systematically defined, analyzed and assessed. Thus, engineers who design and configure their monitoring systems have to take decisions only based on partial knowledge and personal experience. This paper addresses this knowledge gap, by presenting a systematic analysis of 11 probe deployment patterns, their known uses, and implementations. We assess these patterns qualitatively, and quantitatively using both VMs and containers. Results show the targets have negligible resource consumption (e.g., less than 1% CPU usage), while the probe holder consumption is mainly significant in relation to memory consumption, reaching up to 10 GiB in our experiments. Our findings suggest that reusing probes and holders among users can generally enhance efficiency and scalability when direct access to the monitored target is not an option. We generate a set of best practices that can assist engineers in configuring their monitoring systems.

While simple domain-specific graphical languages and libraries can empower a variety of users to create application behaviors and logic, using these languages to produce and maintain a set of heterogeneous client applications is a challenge. Primarily because each client typically requires the developers to both understand and embed the domain-specific logic. This is because application logic must be encoded to some extent in both the server and client sides. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which allows the specification of application logic to reside solely on the cloud. We have built a system where reusable application components can be assembled on the cloud in different logical chains and the client is largely decoupled from this logic and is solely concerned with how data is displayed and gathered from users of the application. In this way, the chaining of requests and responses is done by the cloud and the client side has no knowledge of the application logic. This means that the experts in the domain can build these modular cloud components, arrange them in various logical chains, generate a simple user interface to test the application, and later leave it to client-side developers to customize the presentation and gathering of data types to and from the user. An additional effect of our approach is that the client side developer is able to immediately see any changes they make, while executing the logic residing on the cloud. This further allows more novice programmers to perform these customizations, as they do not need to ‘get the full application working’ and are able to see the results of their code as they go, thereby lowering the obstacles to businesses and individuals to produce and maintain applications. Furthermore, this decoupling enables the quick generation and customization of a variety of application clients, ranging from web to mobile devices and personal assistants, while customizing one or more as needed. Creating new computer applications, distributing them to users, and maintaining them, is complex and time-consuming. Building even a simple application requires years of study. Furthermore, given the number of devices we have today (from smartphones to voice assistants), the task is further complicated and difficult even for experienced programmers. The world is undergoing a digital transformation, and computer applications are now part of our everyday existence and building them is a requirement for many organizations and businesses. How-ever, only companies and individuals with large budgets and skills can build these applications, a consequence of which is an increased digital gap between those with means and those without. We see a clear need to lower the barriers to building these applications so a more diverse set of voices are able to participate and shape our digital futures, as underrepresented groups are often left out of designing and building these platforms. Previous researchers have proposed approaches where applications can be easily specified by people without (or with few) technical skills. However, handling different device platforms and maintenance/distribution were neglected in these efforts. In this paper we propose an approach where the program is executed on the cloud, while the client only needs to display and gather data from users. A result of our approach is that generic front-end applications adapt to any changes to the program being executed on the cloud. Our programs work with end-user apps on any device, the application that the user sees automatically adapts to any changes.","","978-1-6654-9594-3","10.1145/3510458.3513017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793869","domain-specific;activity flow;cloud execution;model-driven engineering","Shape;Buildings;Computer applications;User interfaces;Libraries;Distance measurement;Servers","","","","42","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EDoS aims at incurring economic damages to service provider due to the increased elastic use of resources. Motivated by the limitations of existing defense solutions, we propose FortisEDoS, a novel framework that aims at enabling elastic B5G services that are impervious to EDoS attacks. FortisEDoS integrates a new deep learning-powered DDoS anomaly detection model, dubbed CG-GRU, that capitalizes on the capabilities of emerging graph and recurrent neural networks in capturing spatio-temporal correlations to accurately discriminate malicious behavior. Furthermore, FortisEDoS leverages transfer learning to effectively defeat EDoS attacks in newly deployed slices by exploiting the knowledge learned in a previously deployed slice. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CG-GRU in achieving higher detection performance of more than 92% with lower computation complexity. They show also that transfer learning can yield an attack detection sensitivity of above 91%, while accelerating the training process by at least 61%. Further analysis shows that FortisEDoS exhibits intuitive explainability of its decisions, fostering trust in deep learning-assisted systems.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2023.3318606","EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:101016509); EU's HE research and innovation programme(grant numbers:HORIZON-JU-SNS-2022,101095933); 6G-SANDBOX(grant numbers:101096328); Research Council of Finland(grant numbers:346208); Business Finland 6Bridge 6Core(grant numbers:8410/31/2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262167","AI explainability;anomaly detection;application-layer DDoS;deep transfer learning;economical denial of sustainability (EDoS);network slicing;5G and beyond networks (B5G)","Denial-of-service attack;Computer crime;Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Measurement;Cloud computing;Behavioral sciences","","","","53","CCBY","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To illustrate, Kubernetes is designed to be agnostic to the services that it orchestrates and cannot dynamically reconfigure the 5G core according to existing network resources, i.e., it provides a partial dynamic orchestration to perform network slicing. This paper proposes a solution integrated with K8S to allow full dynamic orchestration of network slicing at runtime, including online adjustments in the 5G core. This integration is accomplished through a K8S-integrated controller for the control plane. The controller adjusts the 5G core and adapts the virtualized infrastructure.

Manual deployment can be time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. Additionally, managing logs and monitoring resources for each deployment can lead to even greater costs. To address these challenges, we propose implementing an automation strategy for deployment in the cloud. With automation, the deployment process can be streamlined and standardized across different cloud providers, reducing the potential for errors and saving time and resources. Furthermore, a central log system can be implemented to manage logs from different deployments in one location. This provides a unified view of all logs and allows for easier troubleshooting and analysis. Automation can also be used to set up monitoring resources, such as alerts and dashboards, across different deployments. Overall, implementing an automation strategy for deployment in the cloud can help organizations save time and resources while improving their ability to manage and monitor their applications. A centralized log management system can further enhance these benefits by providing a unified view of logs from all deployments","","979-8-3503-4438-7","10.1109/ICAICCIT60255.2023.10465818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10465818","Kubernetes;Helm;Prometheus;Grafana;AWS;EC2;EKS;ArgoCD;Keda","Automation;Standards organizations;Organizations;Manuals;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Information and communication technology","","","","22","IEEE","20 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, meeting the requirements of these highly demanding services calls for novel computing architectures that handle extensive device connections, minimize latency, and support multiple resource-intensive services concurrently. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an architecture that comprises three layers: 1) on-board unit (OBU) mainly as a data producer; 2) intermediate edge layer where low-latency backend services can be deployed; and 3) cloud layer for non-real-time backend services. The OBU software stack implements the ETSI C-ITS standard and supports multicast over the cellular network. The edge layer includes an in-memory database, and the cloud layer a persistent database. Each layer has its own Application Programming Interface (API) for data consumption. We conducted several experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed system that ensures scalability and interconnection between vehicles, edge and cloud servers. We also assess the delay caused by each of the elements of the architecture, and we discuss the potential solutions for the identified issues.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3397467","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the Project Monetizing car & mobility data for new Entrants, Technologies and Actors (5GMETA)(grant numbers:957360); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521473","V2X;C-V2X;5G;MEC;cloud;C-ITS","Standards;Computer architecture;Long Term Evolution;Ad hoc networks;Cloud computing;Databases;Low latency communication;Multiaccess communication;Edge computing","","","","53","CCBYNCND","6 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We make the case for a highly performant distributed object store by a) building an abstraction layer to pass immutability and data affinity hints to the underlying storage while also, b) making the Objects layer aware of the hardware configurations enabling the Object Storage controllers to maximise throughput. With these optimizations we show that object storage performance can approach 95% of the maximum possible performance from the underlying raw storage while ensuring that the abstractions are generic enough to be able to run on any general purpose off the shelf storage systems. We have observed these performance gains across more than 1000 customer environments across diverse hardware. We also extend the above optimizations with generic mecha-nisms to offload compute closer to storage that have significant benefits for a broad class of workloads. Specifically, we evaluate performance gains from a) well known constructs like S3 Select for Analytics workloads and b) generic compute offload like Objects Lambda. This ability to offload compute is critical for modern distributed workloads like AI/ML and Analytics processing with very large distributed data sets.","","978-1-6654-9115-0","10.1109/IC2E55432.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9946333","","Protocols;Costs;Buildings;Distributed databases;Performance gain;Throughput;Hardware","","","","25","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this goal, monitoring tools are required to measure the performance and resource consumption at the infrastructure level and map it to the virtual images on top of it to infer the consumption ascribable to a vertical application or a network function.

Today, development teams work closely with the business leveraging agile methods to gather feedback, assess the impact of the changes and deploy changes in a short duration. By taking advantage of the microservices architecture (MSA), large monolithic code is logically broken down into microservices that can be developed, deployed and scaled independently. Applications are leveraging containerization and orchestration technologies along with microservices architecture to package, deploy and manage the code across different environments. The underlying infrastructure and agile processes need to be supported with robust methods to perform code integration and deployments without any service disruption. This paper provides a qualitative assessment of the following code deployment techniques (i) Recreating Deployments (ii) Rolling Deployment (iii) Blue-Green Deployment (iv) Canary Deployment. This assessment can guide enterprises to identify the right code deployment strategy that can be adopted based on the business use case. Next, the paper dives deeper on how the in-built capabilities of Kubernetes along with open-source tools like Istio can be leveraged successfully to implement canary deployments for service changes.

Herein, we propose a microservice data relationship management (MDRM) pattern, which is a heterogeneous metadata management pattern with the ability to maintain relationships with data generated by multiple units via organic relationships. The MDRM pattern is basically a microservice architecture data management pattern that determines data keys shared with each other in metadata generated by a number of units comprising a microservice application. It performs data operations based on keys, including creation, read, update, and deletion, and manages relationships between heterogeneous metadata. This pattern aids in configuring microservice applications where data collected from service units with different metadata must be managed in a single report form, and aggregated or integrated for monitoring.

The reason is in the impossibility of providing the traveling route considering the linkage of social issue solutions and user benefits.

Kubernetes (K8s) provides a Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) mechanism that allows to automatically adjust the number of Pods to closely follow the user demand variations over time. To properly leverage shared resources with HPA, service providers need to limit the use of dedicated resources and overprovisioning. However, in the case of traffic spikes, there may not be enough resources to satisfy the demand. The HPA, which relies on resource usage to drive the scaling, is unaware of how many requests could not be served with the required QoS. This might result in an underestimation of the number of required Pods to be added, leading to additional QoS degradation. This demonstration showcases the effectiveness of a new Pod autoscaling mechanism (i.e., Service Aware Pod Autoscaling (SAPA)) that relies on user request measurements from the service load balancer to better estimate the number of required Pods. SAPA allows selecting the amount of Pod resources (dedicated and shared) in a simple way. We demonstrate the benefits of SAPA by comparing it to a K8s cluster based on the traditional HPA in terms of resource usage and service latency.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175413","Cloud native services;QoS;service degradation;Pod autoscaling;Kubernetes;Shared resources","Degradation;Microservice architectures;Quality of service","","","","13","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, with the popularity of the IoT in the context of edge computing, cloud-native applications that utilize geographically-distributed multiple resources are emerging. In line with this trend, there is an increasing demand for microservices placement that selectively use optimal resources. However, optimal microservices placement is a significant challenge because microservices are dynamic and complex, depending on diversified workloads. Besides, generalizing workloads' characteristics consisting of complex microservices is realistically challenging. Thus, microservices deployment with mathematically structured algorithms based on simulation is less practical. As an alternative, a microservices placement framework is required that can reflect the characteristics of workloads derived from empirical profiling. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a refinement framework for profiling-based microservices placement to identify and respond to workload characteristics in a practical way. To achieve this goal, we perform profiling experiments with selected workloads to derive delicate resource requirements. Then, we perform microservices placement with a greedy-based heuristic algorithm that considers application performance by using resource requirements derived from the profiled results.

A fundamental element of the cloud-native approach is a microservice — an instance, which is usually virtualised, serving for only a defined purpose. Virtualised microservices are mostly used in cloud-based IoT systems, which can be covered with multi-agent system (MAS) paradigm. The maintenance of a MAS requires a constant monitoring to track the system state and to satisfy the service level agreement (SLA) (or any other) requirements. This paper presents a resource efficient reliability model for MAS IoT systems for monitoring purposes. First, we provide a thorough mathematical analysis to describe the generic system model and its elements. This model takes into account SLA requirements and it is characterised with linear time complexity, simplicity of computations and input metrics (e.g., combination of SLA for CPU and its workload), where all of the input data are aligned to the same range. Then, we evaluate time complexity and provide a measurement to demonstrate the reliability of the model application. The results show that the proposed model is efficient for large number of the IoT agents. It is approximately 98 times faster in computation with 1,000 systems when compared with [D.

Another key trend in network softwarization is cloud-native software, which, together with SDN, will be an integral part of the core of future 5G networks. In SDN, the control plane forms the ""brain"" of the software-defined network and is typically implemented as a set of distributed controller replicas to avoid a single point of failure. Distributed consensus algorithms are used to ensure agreement among the replicas on key data even in the presence of faults. Security is also a critical concern in ensuring that attackers cannot compromise the SDN control plane; byzantine fault tolerance algorithms can provide protection against compromised controller replicas. However, while reliability/availability and security form key attributes of resilience, they are typically modeled separately in SDN, without consideration of the potential impacts of their interaction. In this paper we present an initial framework for a model that unifies reliability, availability, and security considerations in distributed consensus. We examine -- via simulation of our model -- some impacts of the interaction between accidental faults and malicious attacks on SDN and suggest potential mitigations unique to cloud-native software.","","978-1-7281-6300-0","10.1109/DRCN48652.2020.1570604424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089388","Software Defined Networks;distributed control plane;distributed consensus;Byzantine Fault Tolerance;Raft;security;reliability;cloud-native software;modeling frameworks","Security;Software;Object oriented modeling;Resilience;Control systems;Fault tolerance","","3","","25","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, RAM is more expensive on the cloud; therefore, a buffer manager that relies exclusively on RAM would not have been a viable solution. Second, on object stores, read and write operations are generally associated with higher latencies. To counteract the impact of higher latencies without utilizing more RAM, we have extended SAP IQ's buffer manager with a second layer of cache, namely, the Extended Cache Manager (ECM).

The NMS plays a crucial role in managing telco elements (TEs) deployed across the country and processing large volume of stateful data per second. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) telecommunications management network defines the stateful NMS management tasks as fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS). However, containerized NMS exhibits ephemeral state, making its management complex. This paper addresses the challenges associated with stateful storage selection, content placement, and content retrieval operations. To overcome these challenges, we propose CAPT, a Context-Aware stateful Processing ecosystem for Telco infrastructure management. Our approach ensures scalability by associating context information directly with FCAPS and TE type, rather than fixed storage entities, thereby maintaining the location-independent philosophy of cloud-native architectures.

To meet these challenges, the 5G network adopts a cloud-native approach, which brings the potential for great flexibility such as dynamic scalability for its network functions. Over the years, Kubernetes became a desirable option for telecom operators as a container orchestration software for cloud-native network solutions thanks to its versatility.As it stands, Kubernetes’ default resource scaling solution HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) represents a significant step forward in addressing the need to dynamically adapt compute resources to current demands.However, this paper shows that in some cases, HPA genericity can be costly in terms of resources mobilized and QoS degradation. Experimental analysis performed on a volatile traffic profile demonstrates the limitations of HPA. We propose a deep learning-based proactive scaling solution to overcome them and balance the cost-QoS trade-off. Essentially, it predicts the future CPU load of the Containerized Network Function (CNF) and makes decisions based on a new scaling algorithm. We also embed our approach in ETSI ZSM (Zero touch network & Service Management) framework. We compare our solution with the standard Kubernetes HPA and another alternative approach found in the state of the art. Our results show that the proposed solution outperforms these scaling mechanisms in terms of maintaining QoS levels during scaling and reducing operational costs.","2771-5663","979-8-3503-1306-2","10.1109/CloudNet59005.2023.10490067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10490067","5G;Cloud-native;Kubernetes;HPA;Proactive and dynamic scaling;Deep learning;ZSM","Degradation;Costs;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Time series analysis;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","","","","25","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A crucial challenge in deploying applications over such a distributed infrastructure is the allocation of resources, considering jointly application-specific security requirements and computing and networking constraints, that increase significantly the complexity of the decision-making process. In this work, we assume varying levels of workload isolation achievable through lightweight virtualization mechanisms, establishing distinct tiers of security and trustworthiness, each with its own quantified computational and storage requirements. We model the respective resource allocation problem, i.e., of provisioning edge-cloud continuum resources for cloud-native applications subject to applications’ performance and security requirements, as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. Additionally, a best-fit heuristic is introduced to reduce the execution time for real-size scenarios, performing a fast allocation of resources for the applications while maintaining a tolerable optimality gap. Finally, a Multi-agent Rollout Mechanism is proposed that trades off execution time with performance, leveraging the greedy heuristic for the approximation of future decisions in a Reinforcement Learning manner.

In this paper, we propose the integration of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and cloud-native virtualization techniques, such as containers, with the MEC architecture, to facilitate the orchestration and management of Mobile Edge Hosts (MEH). The proposed architecture focuses on the end-to-end mobility support required to maintain service continuity when mobile users relocate from one MEH to another. SDN is proposed as a reliable, programmatic paradigm to provide mobile edge orchestration and dynamic configuration of the underlying network for improved service continuity and quality of experience.

NFV decouples network functions from hardware devices. This decoupling allows network services, called Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), to be hosted on commodity hardware which simplifies and enhances service deployment and management for providers, improves flexibility, and leads to efficient and scalable resource usage, and lower costs. The proper placement of VNFs in the hosting infrastructures is one of the main technical challenges. This placement significantly influences the network’s performance, reliability, and operating costs. The VNF placement is NP-Hard. Therefore, there is a need for placement methods that can cope with the complexity of the problem and find appropriate solutions in a reasonable duration. The primary purpose of this study is to provide a taxonomy of optimization techniques used to tackle the VNF placement problems. We classify the studied papers based on performance metrics, methods, algorithms, and environment. Virtualization is not limited to simply replacing physical machines with virtual machines or VNFs, but may also include micro-services, containers, and cloud-native systems.

It can significantly reduce operating costs while shifting the management tasks from developers and application providers towards the cloud operators. But these benefits are provided at the cost of less control over the underlying infrastructure and the application performance, including the end-to-end latency. However, grouping of functions into deployable serverless software artifacts remains still under our control, which has a considerable impact on performance and operation costs. In this paper, we propose fast and efficient algorithms that can partition an application’s functions into separate deployment artifacts in a cost-optimal way while meeting user-defined average end-to-end latency bounds. Moreover, our approach supports the dynamic redesign and reconfiguration of the current deployment setup in response to changes in monitored metrics. Our main contribution is threefold. First, we establish the relevant theoretical models capturing the behavior of the serverless ecosystem and we define the main problem. In addition, the concept of the integrated application management is introduced. Second, we propose novel algorithms providing optimal solutions for different variants of the core problem and the complexity of the methods are analyzed.

Transitioning to fog-native applications, i.e. managing microservice workflows over the fog, is a non-trivial challenge. On one hand, engineering workflows require awareness of the dependencies across microservices, as they impact the perceived quality of service. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of capacities, energy prices and supply, introduce challenges that can negate the sought advantages of the fog. This work proposes a novel algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for intent-based workflow mapping and admission, iADMM.

However, the FaaS abstraction only makes the cloud resource management aspects transparent but does not deal with the application data aspects. As such, developers have to intervene and undergo the burden of managing the application data, often via separate cloud services (e.g., AWS S3). Similarly, the FaaS abstraction does not natively support function workflow, hence, the developers often have to work with workflow orchestration services (e.g., AWS Step Functions) to build workflows. Moreover, they have to explicitly navigate the data throughout the workflow. To overcome these inherent problems of FaaS, our hypothesis is to design a higher-level cloud programming abstraction that can hide the complexities and mitigate the burden of developing cloud-native application development. Accordingly, in this research, we borrow the notion of object from object-oriented programming and propose a new abstraction level atop the function abstraction, known as Object as a Service (OaaS). OaaS encapsulates the application data and function into the object abstraction and relieves the developers from resource and data management burdens. It also unlocks opportunities for built-in optimization features, such as software reusability, data locality, and caching. OaaS natively supports dataflow programming such that developers define a workflow of functions transparently without getting involved in data navigation, synchronization, and parallelism aspects. We implemented a prototype of the OaaS platform and evaluated it under real-world settings against state-of-the-art platforms regarding the imposed overhead, scalability, and ease of use. The results demonstrate that OaaS streamlines cloud programming and offers scalability with an insignificant overhead to the underlying cloud system.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-0481-7","10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254994","FaaS;Serverless paradigm;Cloud computing;Cloud-native programming;Abstraction","Cloud computing;Navigation;Processor scheduling;Scalability;Prototypes;Synchronization;Resource management","","2","","46","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), various scenarios can be implemented in the 5G network. Cloud computing, for example, is one of the important application scenarios for implementing SDN/NFV solutions. The emerging container technologies, such as Docker, can provide more agile service provisioning than virtual machines can do in cloud environments. It is a trend that virtual network functions (VNFs) tend to be deployed in the form of containers. The services provided by clouds can be formed by service function chaining (SFC) consisting of containerized VNFs. Nevertheless, the challenges and limitation regarding SFCs are reported in the literature. Various network services are bound to rely heavily on these novel technologies, however, the development of related technologies often emphasizes functions and ignores security issues. One noticeable issue is the SFC integrity. In brief, SFC integrity concerns whether the paths that traffic flows really pass by and the ones of service chains that are predefined are consistent. In order to examine SFC integrity in the cloud-native environment of 5G network, we propose a framework that can be integrated with NFV management and orchestration (MANO) in this work. The core of this framework is the anomaly detection mechanism for SFC integrity. The learning algorithm of our mechanism is based on extreme learning machine (ELM). The proposed mechanism is evaluated by its performance such as the accuracy of our ELM model.

Advances in cloud computing have driven software technologies that can unlock scaling across hardware systems, introduce service architectures, open new performance possibilities, and decouple historically interlocked components. This paper will address aerospace and defense software challenges, introduce cloud computing, both service-oriented architecture (SOA) and cloud-native microservices, explain underlying principles and tenets, and craft a practical path forward. The cloud will be brought down to earth by showing how some underlying principles and tenets can be used today. These include the single responsibility principle (SRP), DevOps, and gRPC, “a modern open-source high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment.” [1] These practices enable architectures that make obsolescence issues smaller and more approachable. For instance, test hardware and software evolve as available hardware, and the development team's skillsets change over the lifetime of the tester and Unit Under Test (UUT). Using SRP allows individual engineers to troubleshoot isolated portions of complex systems without understanding the entire technology stack. Additionally, partitioning measurement tasks into measurement and analysis subtasks can maximize CPU power by offloading analysis from point-of-use test stations to higher-performance computers. This enables cost savings by removing number crunching from expensive testers and leveraging optimized high-performance computing for analysis tasks. We also show how gRPC natively incorporates low latency, security, and cross-platform interoperability between services. While it is impossible to prevent software, parts, and skills from becoming obsolete, it is possible to mitigate the risks to production through planning, procurement, and system design, including system software design. By walking in the footsteps of cloud computing, we can apply various techniques and technologies from the cloud to automated systems.","","978-1-7281-5400-8","10.1109/AUTOTESTCON47462.2022.9984719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984719","Obsolescence;Cloud;Cloud Native;Service;Service Oriented Architecture","Cloud computing;Power measurement;Computer architecture;Production;Aging;Software;Hardware","","1","","14","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model focuses on the organization of scaling units, and it accounts for the cost of provisioned resources in scale-out periods and invocation delays among the application components.

We showcase the efficiency of our proposed optimization solution by presenting the reduction in operation costs as an illustrative example. We propose to group similarly low scale components together in CaaS, while running dynamically scaled components in FaaS.

Particularly, to deploy different parts of an application across multiple clusters and facilitate their interaction over the external network. Of existing orchestration technologies, Kubernetes emerges as an attractive candidate to address this need, for its emerging support of multi-cluster services. However, meeting the need remains a challenge, as the multi-cluster service API (MCS API) is still in its infancy, lacking the ability to coordinate the scheduling of multiple microservices across clusters. Particularly when clusters belong to different administrative domains. This work proposes FORK ((F)ederated (OR)chestration for (K)ubernetes), a novel solution for orchestrating fog-native workflows over geo-distributed clusters, possibly from different domains. FORK decomposes a workflow into a set of cluster-specific dependency sub-graphs. Each exposing only microservices assigned to the cluster, and ‘dependent’ microservices of peer clusters. An application agent and a set of cluster-local dependency operators are introduced, interacting with cluster-local Kubernetes and using Submariner to deploy cluster parts of the application and chain different parts across-clusters. The FORK solution is utilised to evaluate the performance of fog-native applications and analyse the impact of distribution over multiple clusters. Evaluation results show that distributing CPU-light microservices introduces a significant network overhead that outweighs that of the microservices tasks. Whilst for CPU-intensive counterparts, the overhead ratio is considerably less. The results further show significant savings in manual operations.","2472-8144","979-8-3503-9376-7","10.1109/ICIN60470.2024.10494435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494435","multi-cluster;federation;microservices;fog networks;Kubernetes;cloud-native","Measurement;Technological innovation;Cloud computing;Ecosystems;Microservice architectures;Benchmark testing;Time factors","","","","27","IEEE","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enforce security, traditional Docker container runtime mechanisms are now being enhanced by stronger isolation techniques such as lightweight hardware level virtualization. Such sandboxing inserts a strong boundary - the guest space - and therefore security containers do not share filesystem semantics with the host Operating System. However, the existing container storage drivers are designed and optimized to run directly on the host. In this paper we bridge the gap between traditional containers and virtualized containers. We present Deverlay, a container storage driver that prepares a block-based container root filesystem view, targeting lightweight Virtual Machines and keeping host native execution compatibility.

For example, when it comes to data-intensive cloud-native applications, the tenant might be eager to provision cloud resources in an economical manner while ensuring that the application performance meets the requirements in terms of data throughput. However, due to the complexity of the interplay between the building blocks, adequately setting resource limits of the components separately for various data rates is nearly impossible. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach that consists of measuring the resource footprint and data throughput performance of such a microservices-based application, analyzing the measurement results by data mining techniques, and finally formulating an optimization problem that aims to minimize the allocated resources given the performance constraints. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach on Cortex, an extension to Prometheus for storing monitored metrics data. The data-intensive nature of this illustrative example stems from real-time monitoring of metrics exposed by a multitude of applications running in a data center and the continuous analysis performed on the collected data that can be fetched from Cortex. We present Cortex’s performance vs resource footprint trade-off, and then we build regression models to predict the microservices’ resource consumption and draw a mathematical programming formulation to optimize the most important configuration parameters. Our most important finding is the linear relationship between resource consumption and application performance, which allows for applying linear regression and linear programming models. After the optimization, we compare our results to Cortex’s recommendation, leading to a CPU reservation reduced by 50-80%.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-0601-7","10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789857","Innovation Fund; Innovation Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789857","cloud-native;microservices;performance;re-source footprint;optimization","Measurement;Cloud computing;Biological system modeling;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Throughput;Brain modeling","","","","15","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in most real-world cases, the adoption of microservices is not a deliberate choice made by organizations. Instead, the shift towards microservices is compelled by the urgent necessity to overcome the constraints imposed by traditional monolithic architectures. As a result, organizations typically seek to migrate their existing systems to microservices incrementally and with caution to ensure safe migration. To achieve this particular goal, the industry has provided various strategies and patterns. However, many practitioners overlook a very important aspect while migrating to microservices, which is the presence of anti-patterns and their potential evolution during the migration phases. Therefore, studies and investigations are needed to assist the migration task to microservices against anti-patterns. Accordingly, this paper brings attention to a research gap concerning the impact of anti-patterns on migrating to microservices. This gap is addressed through the formulation of four research questions. The main aim is to inspire the academic community to conduct additional investigations in this area, aiming to improve migration quality and facilitate the development of more efficient architectures.","","979-8-3503-0306-3","10.1109/CloudTech58737.2023.10366131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366131","component;Cloud Native;Monolithic Architecture;Microservices Architecture;Anti-Patterns;Migration Challenges","Industries;Cloud computing;Microservice architectures;Organizations;Computer architecture;Task analysis;Artificial intelligence","","","","17","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Elastic pod containers attracts and helps the application developers in developing and executing the cloud-native modern applications with key benefits such as light weight, agility to launch, easy deployment through images, consuming less power, minimum cost, less carbon footprints with increased resource utilization and provisioning on public cloud data centers. In existing, reactive auto-scaling mechanism of pod resources is used to add or remove resources manually or rule based for handling static workloads from users and most of the times it may lead to over provision or under provisioning of instances that violates QOS and SLA. In this paper, predictive horizontal scaling of pods utilizing custom metrics with orchestration through Kuberenetes is proposed with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based on Deep Learning (DL) technique. DL is data hungry for right prediction of replicas of a cluster that is needed in advance to run cyclic workloads and to handle the sudden spike of demand by using the cloud large dataset real time traces. Moreover, LSTM model is compared with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and experimental results shows that the results of LSTM prediction has less absolute error rate on comparing with GRU to keep the resource provisioning accuracy better for running the modern workloads seamlessly on public cloud.","","978-1-6654-9710-7","10.1109/ICAAIC53929.2022.9792749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792749","Container Virtu aliza tion;Pods;Predictive Scaling;Replicas;Agility;Elasticity;Cloud-native applications","Measurement;Cloud computing;Error analysis;Quality of service;Containers;Predictive models;Logic gates","","","","22","IEEE","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A symmetric paradigm applies to smart contracts as well, which represent well defined, usually isolated, executable programs, typically implementing simple and autonomous tasks with a well defined purpose, which can be assumed as services provided by the Contract. In this work we analyze a concrete case study where the microservices architecture environment is replicated and implemented through an equivalent set of smart contracts, showing for the first time the feasibility of implementing a microservices-based system with smart contracts and how the two innovative paradigms match together. Results show that it is possible to implement a simple microservices-based system with smart contracts maintaining the same set of functionalities and results.

In the radio access network (RAN) however, service customization and functionality extension remain a challenge due to the rigid and complex nature of the RAN and the fact that all services have to be mapped onto the scarce radio resources. In this article, we present the RAN service engine that allows services to customize and extend RAN functionality using containerized micro-services. This is achieved through micro-SDKs that abstract key RAN control endpoints, and which can then be used by the services to flexibly customize and extend the RAN in order to steer control plane behavior. Through these micro-SDKs, the engine can enforce isolation between services while multiplexing them efficiently onto the infrastructure. We also present a concrete implementation of the engine with its key micro-SDKs, and demonstrate the feasibility through a prototype for the MAC scheduling control endpoint, showing the versatility of the RAN engine.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3057642","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:857201 (5G-VICTORI),957317 (Affordable5G),101017226 (6GBRAINS)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349762","5G;RAN;service;customization;extension;slicing;cloud-native","Radio access networks;Base stations;Virtualization;Cloud computing;5G mobile communication;Process control;Engines","","11","","38","IEEE","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the diversity of machine learning libraries, the inconsistency between environments, and various scalability requirement, there is no existing work to date that addresses all of these challenges. Here, we introduce Bighead, a framework-agnostic, end-to-end platform for machine learning. It offers a seamless user experience requiring only minimal efforts that span feature set management, prototyping, training, batch (offline) inference, real-time (online) inference, evaluation, and model lifecycle management. In contrast to existing platforms, it is designed to be highly versatile and extensible, and supports all major machine learning frameworks, rather than focusing on one particular framework. It ensures consistency across different environments and stages of the model lifecycle, as well as across data sources and transformations. It scales horizontally and elastically in response to the workload such as dataset size and throughput. Its components include a feature management framework, a model development toolkit, a lifecycle management service with UI, an offline training and inference engine, an online inference service, an interactive prototyping environment, and a Docker image customization tool. It is the first platform to offer a feature management component that is a general-purpose aggregation framework with lambda architecture and temporal joins. Bighead is deployed and widely adopted at Airbnb, and has enabled the data science and engineering teams to develop and deploy machine learning models in a timely and reliable manner. Bighead has shortened the time to deploy a new model from months to days, ensured the stability of the models in production, facilitated adoption of cutting-edge models, and enabled advanced machine learning based product features of the Airbnb platform.

To that end, we identify the performance limitations of the proposed solution under various deployment infrastructures by studying two prominent use cases: one proposing a distributed marketplace solution for 5G slice brokering and another one on the decentralization of federated learning (FL) through blockchain. For the slice brokering use case, our experiments showed that sub-second latency could be achieved for a maximum transaction throughput in the range of 10 to 200 transactions per second (TPS), whereas use cases requiring a higher throughput (300 to 400 TPS) would need more computational resources. Meanwhile, the FL use case provided insights into the achievable accuracy of distributed learning under various blockchain settings (public, consortium, and private), which led to the understanding that private and consortium blockchains can achieve acceptable accuracy in significantly lower training times compared to public blockchains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309423","Irish Research Council(grant numbers:GOIPD/2020/333); Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:14/IA/252 (O’SHARE),13/RC/2077); Google Cloud; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10232988","5G network slicing;blockchain for telecom;blockchained federated learning;blockchain scalability;cloud-native distributed ledger;cost analysis;permissioned blockchain;smart contracts","Blockchains;Telecommunications;Costs;Ecosystems;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Consensus protocol;Federated learning;Cloud computing;Distributed ledger","","5","","62","CCBYNCND","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Applications have evolved from large monoliths to complex graphs of loosely-coupled microservices aiming to improve deployment flexibility and operational efficiency. However, modern microservice-based architectures are challenging since proper allocation and scaling of microservices is a difficult task due to their complex inter-dependencies. Existing works do not consider microservice dependencies, which could lead to the application’s performance degradation when service demand increases. This paper studies the impact of microservice interdependencies in auto-scaling mechanisms by proposing a novel framework named gym-hpa that enables different auto-scaling goals via Reinforcement Learning (RL). The framework has been developed based on the OpenAI Gym library for the popular Kubernetes (K8s) platform to bridge the gap between RL and auto-scaling research by training RL agents on real cloud environments. The aim is to improve resource usage and reduce the application’s response time in future cloud platforms by considering microservice inter-dependencies in horizontal scaling. Experiments with microservice benchmark applications show that RL agents trained with the gym-hpa framework can reduce on average resource usage by 30% and reduce the application’s response time by 25% compared to default scaling mechanisms.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-7716-1","10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154298","Auto-scaling;Containers;Cloud-native;Microservices;Orchestration;Reinforcement Learning;Kubernetes","Training;Degradation;Microservice architectures;Reinforcement learning;Containers;Benchmark testing;Libraries","","5","","48","IEEE","21 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications can use CPU/Memory with repetitive patterns, following a trend over time independently. By identifying such patterns, resource forecasting models can be fit better, reducing over/under-provisioning via fewer resizing operations. Here we present ThetaScan, a time-series analysis method for vertical auto-scaling of containers in the Cloud, based on the detection of stationarity/trending and periodicity on resource consumption. Our method leverages the Theta Forecaster algorithm with deseasonalization that, in our provisioning scenario, only requires the estimated periodicity for resource consumption as principal hyper-parameter. Commonly used behavior detection methods require manual hyper-parameter tuning, making them infeasible for automation. Besides, it can be used at multi-scales (minute/hour/day), detecting hourly and daily patterns to improve resource usage prediction. Experiments show that we can detect behaviors in resource consumption that common methods miss, without requiring extensive manual tuning. We can reduce the resizing triggers compared to fixed-size scheduling around ~ 10% – 15%, reduce over-provisioning of CPU and Memory through periodic-based provisioning. Also a ~ 60% on multiscale resource forecasting for traces showing periodicity at different levels in respect to single-scale.","2159-6190","978-1-6654-0060-2","10.1109/CLOUD53861.2021.00054","Generalitat de Catalunya(grant numbers:2014-SGR-1051); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582179","Cloud Native;Machine Learning;Container;Auto-scaling;Stationarity Detection;Periodicity Detection;Time series Forecasting;Theta Forecaster","Cloud computing;Time series analysis;Manuals;Machine learning;Containers;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","1","","15","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It offers automatic deployment, maintenance, scaling, and resource management for applications. Applications in k8s usually have different storage requirements in the form of service-level objectives (SLOs). However, the current k8s storage management has several limitations which cause explicit performance and cost overhead. K8s administrators have to configure storage in advance manually, and users must know configurations and capabilities of provided storage. Users' storage SLOs can be easily violated in k8s.In this paper, we design and implement k8s Enhanced Storage (k8sES) which efficiently supports applications with various storage SLOs along with all other requirements in the Kubernetes environment. We design and incorporate storage scheduling as part of the node scheduling process in k8s. Applications will be scheduled onto the correct nodes and storage without intervention from either users or administrators. Proper storage resources will be dynamically carved based on users' storage SLOs. In addition, we provide a tool to monitor the I/O activities of both applications and storage devices in k8sES. The evaluation shows that k8sES can better meet users' storage SLOs along with other requirements.

Previous works use call graph to characterize causality relation-ships of microservices but not completely or comprehensively, leading to an insufficient search of potential root cause nodes and consequently poor accuracy in culprit localization. In this paper, we propose ImpactTracer to address the above problems. ImpactTracer builds impact graph to provide a com-plete view of fault propagation in microservices and uses a novel backward tracing algorithm that exhaustively traverses the impact graph to identify the root cause node accurately.

This vision aims to embed AI/Machine Learning (ML) into the AI/ML architectures of Standardization Development Organizations (SDOs) such as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Our second contribution is a numerical comparison of the benefits of the proposed distributed management and orchestration approach in terms of energy savings through Federated Learning (FL). The experimental topology includes a sophisticated infrastructure with VR streaming clients and servers, a monitoring system (MS), core network elements, aggregation server for federated learning (FL) and analytics engines (AEs). The deployment uses Kubernetes (K8s) and a top orchestrator that works together with an AI/ML model tailored to the envisioned use case. Experimental studies emulating the demanding Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming have demonstrated the effectiveness of the MonB5G framework in optimizing resource management, reducing overhead and improving energy efficiency. In particular, when convergence is achieved, the monitoring overhead is reduced by more than 11 times compared to the centralised SLA-constrained algorithm, along with data-driven management systems. This led to a more than 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency.

We propose FedOps, federated learning operations for constructing systematic FL project by enhancing machine learning operations (MLOps) to be effectively applied to FL while preserving its core process. To address complexity of FL implementation, we developed FedOps platform, which involves FedOps-based projects to manage the whole lifecycle in FL context. We also investigated methods to identify performance degradation factors in FL and suggest an approach for improvement. FedOps Platform provides an analysis tool for client heterogeneity, called chunk-bench. This tool enables researchers and engineers to gain insights into systems heterogeneity by using only small chunk of the clients’ data to execute test in the shortest time possible while tracking the systems heterogeneity across the clients. By addressing systems heterogeneity, FedOps Platform achieved 13%–43% improvement in communication cost-to-accuracy and 20%–68% improvement in time-to-accuracy.

While there are a range of tools and techniques to verify various properties of a system under consideration, in this work, we restrict our attention to safety checking procedures using explicit state space generation. The necessary hardware resources required in this approach depends on the model complexity and the resulting state transition graph that gets generated. This cannot be estimated apriori. For reasonably realistic models, the available main memory in even high end servers may not be sufficient. Hence, we have to use distributed safety verification approaches on a cluster of nodes. However, the problem of estimating the minimum number of nodes in the cluster for the verification procedure to complete successfully remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a dynamically scalable model checker using an actor based architecture. Using the proposed approach, an end user can invoke a model checker hosted on a cloud platform in a push button fashion. Our safety verification procedures automatically expands the cluster by requesting more virtual machines from the cloud provider. Finally, the user gets to pay only for the hardware resources he rented for the duration of the verification procedure. We refer to this as Model Checking as Service. We approach this problem by proposing an asynchronous algorithm for safety checking in actor framework. The actor based approach allows for scaling the resources on a need basis and redistributes the work load transparently through state migration. We tested our approach by developing a distributed version of SpinJA model checker using Akka actor framework. We conducted our experiments on Google Cloud Engine (GCE) platform wherein we scale our resources automatically using the GCE API. On large models such as anderson.8 from BEEM benchmark suite, our approach reduced the model checking cost in dollars by 8.6x while reducing the wall clock time to complete the safety checking procedure 5.5x times.","2640-0316","978-1-6654-2292-5","10.1109/HiPC50609.2020.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406748","Model Checking;Cloud Native;Horizontal Scaling;Actor model;Distributed Asynchronous computing","Cloud computing;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Model checking;Tools;Hardware;Data models","","","","23","IEEE","28 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If an insecure function becomes a serverless function, a significant security risk will be brought to its service. This paper analyzes the risk of asymmetric DDoS attacks faced by insecure serverless functions. These attacks can occupy a large amount of CPU or memory resources without redundant connections. They can affect the quality of service, delay response time, or even interrupt the service. Autoscaling lacks resilience to such attacks. We test the effects of these attacks in experimental environments and Alibaba Cloud's serverless application engine (SAE). In SAE, we increase the response time from 0.2 seconds to 25 seconds or crash the target function within 6 seconds.

Applications designed for Cloud-Native architectures are being migrated from traditional monolithic approach to a Microservices architecture, in which an application is broken down into a collection of small, independent and collaborative services. These applications are dynamically scheduled and managed by Cloud Native platforms. Container Orchestrators (CO), such as Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, enable the deployment and management of stateless and scalable microservices. However, as more and more stateful applications and workloads are being deployed in Cloud-Native platforms, these platforms must support the workloads by providing persistent storage to the microservices so that data can be protected and accessed beyond the lifecycle of an ephemeral container. In this paper, we present the design and development of a Cloud-Native storage service orchestration platform by leveraging capabilities of the IBM Ubiquity framework. Our ultimate goal is to provide persistent storage across different container orchestrators and supporting multi-protocol access for Volume management within the storage systems, such as SSH, REST, GPFS native protocol using CLI, NFS and Object. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the storage service orchestration development vision by providing a prototype implementation using Docker and General Parallel Filesystem (GPFS), aiming to provide shared storage volumes to containers orchestrated by Docker. As the volume and variety of microservices continue to grow and to dominate the development and deployments of Cloud applications, we conjecture that the proposed storage service orchestration framework will be a critical enabling building block for supporting elastic, reliable and effective microservice architectures in Cloud datacenters.","","978-1-5386-9502-9","10.1109/CIC.2018.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537844","Microservices;Cloud datacenters;Persistent storage;service orchestration","Containers;Protocols;Cloud computing;Noise measurement;Computer architecture;Connectors;Databases","","3","1","23","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Storage-compute separation architecture with cloud characteristics is designed to process complex and changeable workloads to reduce resource coupling for cloud-native databases. During processing query loads, the computing layer pushes the operator tasks in execution plans generated from loads down to the storage layer through the network. Query optimization techniques such as operator pushdown and parallel computing have been developed and perfected to improve query speed in storage and compute separation architecture. But at the same time, these technologies also increase the complexity of execution plans, leading to an increase in tasks. Moreover, the experiment shows that under the same query load, the cloud-native database executes a significantly greater number of tasks compared to the distributed database. Given the above phenomenon, the concept of query task fragmentation is proposed. From the view of operator pushdown and parallel computing query optimization, the presence of query task fragmentation is verified through experiments. Experimental results based on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that, compared to MySQL distributed cluster, the average number of operator tasks in the execution plan, generated through operator pushdown and parallel computing for the cloud-native databases, increases by 20.17% and 39.49%, respectively. Finally, the impact of task fragmentation is analyzed from the perspectives of technical research and the application of cloud-native databases.","","979-8-3503-2907-0","10.1109/ICNGN59831.2023.10396786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10396786","storage and compute separation;query task fragmentation;operator pushdown;parallel computing","Couplings;Query processing;Distributed databases;Computer architecture;Parallel processing;Task analysis;Next generation networking","","","","20","IEEE","25 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It enables infrastructure providers to cost effectively customize logical networks over a shared infrastructure. A critical component of network slicing is resource allocation, which needs to ensure that slices receive the resources needed to support their services while optimizing network efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to slice-based resource allocation named Guaranteed seRvice Efficient nETwork slicing (GREET). The underlying concept is to set up a constrained resource allocation game, where ( $i$ ) slices unilaterally optimize their allocations to best meet their (dynamic) customer loads, while ( $ii$ ) constraints are imposed to guarantee that, if they wish so, slices receive a pre-agreed share of the network resources. The resulting game is a variation of the well-known Fisher market, where slices are provided a budget to contend for network resources (as in a traditional Fisher market), but (unlike a Fisher market) prices are constrained for some resources to ensure that the pre-agreed guarantees are met for each slice. In this way, GREET combines the advantages of a share-based approach (high efficiency by flexible sharing) and reservation-based ones (which provide guarantees by assigning a fixed amount of resources). We characterize the Nash equilibrium, best response dynamics, and propose a practical slice strategy with provable convergence properties. Extensive simulations exhibit substantial improvements over network slicing state-of-the-art benchmarks.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2023.3262810","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1910112); University of Texas at Austin through the Salvador de Madariaga Grant of the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports; European Union’s Horizon-JU-SNS-2022 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101095871 (TrialsNet)); Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation and the European Union-NextGenerationEU through the UNICO 5G I+D 6G-CLARION 6GCLARION (a global ecosystem for cloud-native network functions for 6G networks) Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107421","Resource management;base stations;network slicing;dynamic scheduling;vehicle dynamics","Resource management;Base stations;Network slicing;Games;Dynamic scheduling;Vehicle dynamics;Physical layer","","4","","48","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among these specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), network reliability must be carefully pondered to guarantee the safety of the human operators at any time while investing the proper level of resources. For this reason, this paper presents an optimization problem that finds the best set of redundant radio bearers for each User Equipment (UE) in the factory area while accounting for the resource usage. Such problem extends the current specification on redundant transmissions. Several heuristics have been designed to achieve the desired time scales that could not be fulfilled with an exhaustive search. Results show that the optimization algorithm and the heuristics provide the same outcomes in terms of selected bearers and loss rates, but the latter do so at significantly more stringent time scales.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3298171","Huawei-CNIT Joint Innovation Center (JIC) Project “From Cloud-Native Applications’ Orchestration to Beyond-5G Network Automation” (CTN); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190729","B5G;Industry 40;HRC;reliability","Reliability;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Service robots;Production facilities;Collaboration","","","","30","IEEE","24 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Throughout this market engagement, uncertainties stemming from renewable energy sources and market prices present significant revenue risks for VPPs. Addressing this challenge, the paper proposes a VPP bidding risk management model centered on dominance constraints. In contrast to conventional methods reliant on risk metrics like Conditional Value at Risk, the proposed model offers improved control over downside and tail risks while reducing optimization iterations to just one, thus substantially reducing computational cost associated with risk management. The study also contrasts the efficacy and computational costs of first-order and second-order dominance models. For instance, in a three-scenario benchmark, the first-order dominance model exhibits a 16.7% lower overall risk level compared to the second-order model. Similarly, in a nine-scenario benchmark, the computational time of the first-order model increases by 0.96% due to the introduction of binary variables, and this increase scales with the number of benchmark scenarios. The paper additionally incorporates mean deviation of profits and expected excess returns to develop a bi-objective optimization model. This model not only fulfills risk control requisites but also shapes return distributions to align more closely with VPP decision-makers’ profit preferences. The case study is based on a VPP comprising conventional thermal units, wind turbines, energy storage stations, and flexible loads.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3392487","Research and Application of Key Technologies for Cloud-Native Multi-Active Disaster Recovery Electricity Spot Market System(grant numbers:000005KK52220024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506516","VPP;electricity market;bidding strategy;risk control;dominance constraints","Energy storage;Benchmark testing;Renewable energy sources;Power generation;Uncertainty;Costs;Power markets;Electricity supply industry;Risk management","","","","29","CCBYNCND","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The poor interconnect and I/O performance in cloud, HPC-agnostic cloud schedulers, and the inherent heterogeneity and multi-tenancy in cloud are some bottlenecks for effective HPC in cloud. Our primary thesis is that cloud is suitable for some HPC applications not all applications, and for those applications, cloud can be more cost-effective compared to typical dedicated HPC platforms using intelligent application-to-platform mapping, HPC-aware cloud schedulers, and cloud-aware HPC execution and parallel runtime system. To address the challenges, and to exploit the opportunities offered by HPC-clouds, we make Open-Stack Nova scheduler HPC-aware and Charm++ parallel runtime system cloud-aware.

Traditionally, application development followed a waterfall and monolithic approach. Whereas cloud-native follows a microservices and agile approach. This cloud-native approach has many advantages over traditional approaches. However, relying on a single cloud vendor will create a number of issues like single-vendor dependency, the problem of reliability and availability, as no single cloud service provider has the best tools for everything. To remove this single-vendor dependency, Cloud-Architects use a multi-cloud environment. Multi-cloud refers to the use of many cloud providers and services in a single cloud network infrastructure. Multi-cloud environments are used to gain all benefits from different vendors like distribute computing resources, minimum downtime and high data availability. Organizations are using multi-cloud to increase their computing power and services availability for a business. In recent years, cloud service advances have led to a shift from private clouds to multi-tenant clouds and hybrid clouds. This multi-cloud will be a mixed environment that will take advantage of many infrastructure environments, such as private and public clouds.","2575-7288","978-1-6654-0816-5","10.1109/ICACCS54159.2022.9785124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785124","Multi-Cloud;Grafana;Prometheus;Istio;Anthos;Kubernetes","Measurement;Cloud computing;Instruments;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Organizations;Reliability","","8","","16","IEEE","7 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Native execution speed and fast startup time make Wasm an alternative for container-based cloud applications. Despite its security-by-design strategy, however, WebAssembly suffers from a variety of vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which hinder its rapid adoption in cloud computing. For instance, the native execution performance attracted cybercriminals to abuse Wasm binaries for the purpose of resource stealing such as cryptojacking. Without proper defense mechanisms, Wasm-based malware would proliferate, causing huge financial loss of cloud users. Moreover, the design principle that allows type-unsafe languages such as C/C++ inherently induces various memory bugs in an Wasm binary. Efficient and robust vulnerability analysis techniques are necessary to protect benign cloud-native Wasm applications from being exploited by attackers. Due to the young age of WebAssembly, however, there are few works in the literature that provide developers guidance to such security techniques. This makes developers to hesitate considering Wasm as their cloud-native platform. In this paper, we surveyed various techniques and methods for Wasm binary security proposed in the literature and systematically classified them according to certain criteria.

The validated requirements model contains the precise definitions of functionality and data structure that can help in microservices identification. In this paper, we present a tool named RM2MS to further alleviate the problem of cloud-native application development to support automatic identification of microservices from the validated requirements model.

Compared with traditional cloud workloads, serverless functions exhibit unprecedented heterogeneity, variability, and dynamicity. Designing cloud-native power management schemes for serverless functions requires significant engineering effort. Current solutions remain sub-optimal since their orchestration process is often one-sided, lacking a systematic view. A key obstacle to truly efficient function deployment is the fundamental wide abstraction gap between the upper-layer request scheduling and the low-level hardware execution.In this work, we show that the optimal operating point (OOP) for energy efficiency cannot be attained without synthesizing the multi-dimensional attributes of functions. We present FIRST, a novel mechanism that enables servers to better orchestrate serverless functions. The key feature of FIRST is that it leverages a lightweight Internal Representation and meta-Scheduling (IRS) layer for collecting the maximum potential revenue from the servers. Specifically, FIRST follows a pipeline-style workflow. Its frontend components aim to analyze functions from different angles and expose their key features to the system. Meanwhile, its backend components are able to make informed function assignment decisions to avoid OOP divergence. We further demonstrate the way to create extensions based on FIRST to enable versatile cloud-native power management. In total, our design constitutes a flexible management layer that supports power-aware function deployment. We show that FIRST could allow 94% functions to be processed under the OOP, which brings up to 24% energy efficiency improvements.","1530-2075","979-8-3503-3766-2","10.1109/IPDPS54959.2023.00091","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177391","FaaS;power management;multicore","Distributed processing;Systematics;Power system management;Serverless computing;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Behavioral sciences","","","","40","IEEE","18 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we adapt the cloud native approach and related operating techniques for latency sensitive IoT applications operated on public serverless platforms. We argue that solely adding cloud resources to the edge is not enough and other mechanisms and operation layers are required to achieve the desired level of quality. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose a novel system on top of a public serverless edge cloud platform, which can dynamically optimize and deploy the microservice-based software layout based on live performance measurements. We add two control loops and the corresponding mechanisms which are responsible for the online reoptimization at different timescales. The first one addresses the steady-state operation, while the second one provides fast latency control by directly reconfiguring the serverless runtime environments. Second, we apply our general concepts to one of today's most widely used and versatile public cloud platforms, namely, Amazon's AWS, and its edge extension for IoT applications, called Greengrass. Third, we characterize the main operation phases and evaluate the overall performance of the system.

To cope with these challenges, vendors are forming partnerships with other firms to access and leverage new and complementary resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Building on prior work on two traditionally distinct literature streams-interfirm networks and software ecosystems-we theorize that structural characteristics of a software vendor's partner network can influence its firm value. Specifically, we argue and find empirical support that partner network size, interconnectedness, and diversity impact firm value, measured by market capitalization for publicly listed firms and total funding for privately held firms, and that the association between structure and firm value differs by vendor type (legacy versus cloud-native).

The increasing number of co-located services/workloads into server facilities stresses resource availability and system capability in an unconventional and unpredictable manner. To efficiently manage resources in such dynamic environments, run-time observability and forecasting are required to capture workload sensitivities under differing interference effects, according to applied co-location scenarios. While several research efforts have emerged on interference-aware performance modelling, they are usually applied at a very coarse-grained manner e.g., estimating the overall performance degradation of an application, thus failing to effectively quantify, predict or provide educated insights on the impact of continuous runtime interference on per-resource allocations. In this paper, we present Rusty, a predictive monitoring system that leverages the power of Long Short-Term Memory networks to enable fast and accurate runtime forecasting of key performance metrics and resource stresses of cloud-native applications under interference. We evaluate Rusty under a diverse set of interference scenarios for a plethora of representative cloud workloads, showing that Rusty i) achieves extremely high prediction accuracy, average R2 value of 0.98, ii) enables very deep prediction horizons retaining high accuracy, e.g., R2 of around 0.99 for a horizon of 1 sec ahead and around 0.94 for an horizon of 5 sec ahead, while iii) satisfying, at the same time, the strict latency constraints required to make Rusty practical for continuous predictive monitoring at runtime.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2020.3013948","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme(grant numbers:825061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158547","predictive monitoring;system predictability;LSTM networks;interference aware;multi-tenant systems","Monitoring;Interference;Runtime;Resource management;Measurement;Degradation;Servers","","27","","88","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Provided by more than one hundred vendors, it has the potential to protect the customer from vendor lock-in. However, the open-source k8s distribution consists of many optional and alternative features that must be explicitly activated and may depend on pre-configured system components. As a result, incompatibilities still may ensue among Kubernetes vendors. Mostly managed k8s services typically restrict the customizability of Kubernetes. This paper firstly compares the most relevant k8s vendors and, secondly, analyses the potential of Kubernetes to detect and configure compatible support for required features across vendors in a uniform manner. Our comparison is performed based on documented features, by testing, and by inspection of the configuration state of running clusters. Our analysis focuses on the potential of the end-to-end testing suite of Kubernetes to detect support for a desired feature in any Kubernetes vendor and the possibility of reconfiguring the studied vendors with missing features in a uniform manner. Our findings are threefold: First, incompatibilities arise between default cluster configurations of the studied vendors for approximately 18% of documented features. Second, matching end-to-end tests exist only for around 64% of features and for 17% of features these matching tests are not well developed for all vendors. Third, almost all feature incompatibilities can be resolved using a vendor-agnostic API. These insights are beneficial to avoid feature incompatibilities already in cloud-native application engineering processes. Moreover, the end-to-end testing suite can be extended in currently unlighted areas to provide better feature coverage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045768","Adaptive Distributed Software (ADDIS) Project (Research Fund KU Leuven); CloudTRANSIT Project (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)(grant numbers:13FH021PX4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9298825","Computer systems organization;architectures;distributed architectures;cloud computing","Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Containers;Testing;Configuration management;Open source software","","5","","107","CCBY","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this way, EC practitioners aim to replicate the benefits of cloud computing but closer to the source of the data, reducing the latency imposed by the distance between the cloud and the end devices, the network overhead, and the security and privacy risk that this offloading entails. But not only that. EC practitioners also aim to replicate best practices used on cloud-native development and operation. In this regard, GitOps is one of the main trends in the DevOps ecosystem for Continuous Deployment (CD) that promotes infrastructure automation in highly distributed applications, accelerating value delivery while avoiding error-prone manual processes. Till now, GitOps has been mainly related to Kubernetes—a widely used container orchestration platform to run distributed applications resiliently. In this regard, more and more IoT EC solutions are implementing container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes, thus, it is worthwhile identifying the benefits that GitOps adoption could leverage at the Edge and how possible challenges and drawbacks could be addressed. This paper presents a proof of concept based on tools included in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape to check the feasibility of applying GtiOps in IoT EC solutions. Several drawbacks were detected mainly due to the used tooling, such as lack of automatic provisioning of physical infrastructure, tight coupled to Kubernetes descriptors for declaring workloads, and limitations on the edge devices that can be supported.","2166-0727","978-9-8933-3436-2","10.23919/CISTI54924.2022.9820108","Agencia Estatal de Investigación; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820108","GitOps;DevOps;IoT;IoT Edge Computing","Cloud computing;Runtime environment;Automation;Image edge detection;Ecosystems;Pipelines;Containers","","3","","15","","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network functions processing millions of packets per second, earlier run as proprietary physical boxes, are now being realized as disaggregated container based microservices (CNFs) running on commodity clusters managed by orchestrators, like Kubernetes, on Telco clouds. While container orchestrators have evolved to meet the needs of enterprise applications, Telco workloads still remain a second class citizen, as the orchestrator is presently unaware of the networking needs of CNFs and cannot guarantee QoS of network intensive functions. In this work, we examine orchestration of network sensitive functions and identify the key networking requirements of containerized Telco workloads from the orchestration platform.

They are a crucial part of today's network operation and ensure customizable, reliable, and secure communication. This being said, they also have a noteworthy drawback: they are consumed in a static manner. As a consequence, the management of network services is too complex and thus expensive and error-prone. Furthermore, this static processing cannot react to network changes: a service outage, a link failure, or any other network events can result in connectivity loss for customers and has to be usually resolved manually. This paper proposes a practical solution for dynamic, event-triggered, and fast path calculations that program services and permit a so-called service chain. To allow programming services directly in the backbone of a service provider network is solving the static service consumption in service provider networks. The solution is based on the functionalities of Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6 in short), which implements the source-based routing paradigm with the native IPv6 encapsulation. Our focus was set on finding the best reliable and fast way to calculate the best path through the given service instances. Because service provider networks are constantly growing, an algorithm has to be found and implemented so that the growth of the network has no impact on the calculation performance. A complete cloud-native development approach has been taken to create the application as elastic and fault-tolerant as possible. Thanks to the cloud-native approach, the application can be portable in a different environment, in an on-premise datacenter, or directly in the public cloud.","2165-963X","978-3-903176-36-2","10.23919/CNSM52442.2021.9615567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615567","Segment Routing;SRv6;Service Programming;Scalability;Performance","Encapsulation;Cloud computing;Fault tolerance;Firewalls (computing);Fault tolerant systems;Manuals;Programming","","2","","20","","2 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing amount of data generated, most firms have migrated to cloud platforms to reduce operational overhead and infrastructural costs. Corporate data in the cloud is often vulnerable to data breaches and losses. Hence, protecting the data stored on cloud-native assets is quintessential. Over the years, several approaches to disaster recovery have been proposed and most of the solutions focus on a server-based architecture. With the advent of cloud computing, serverless computing is emerging at an exponential rate considering the benefits it offers. Serverless computing lets users focus on developing their business logic rather than managing server configurations. In contrast to a server-based architecture for data protection; a serverless architecture is cost-efficient as it works on a pay-as- you-go model. This paper proposes a microservices-based approach to protect cloud-native assets using a serverless framework. In this approach, cloud assets are first discovered and their snapshot-based backup is taken. The backed-up assets can be later used to recover the asset in case of any disaster or data loss. Further, we also elaborate on the methodology of building a data protection application with Boto3 (Amazon Web Services - Software development Kit for Python) and integrating it with various Amazon Web Services.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Enterprises are increasingly moving their production workloads to the cloud to take advantage of capabilities, such as streamlined provisioning of infrastructure and services, elasticity, scalability, reliability, and security. To leverage such capabilities, monolithic applications typically have to be decomposed to cloud-native architectures, such as microservices. A microservice encapsulates a small and well-defined set of business functionalities and interacts with other services using lightweight mechanisms, often implemented as RESTful APIs. A recent report shows that only 20% of the enterprise workloads are in the cloud, and they were predominately written for native cloud architectures. This leaves 80% of legacy applications onpremises, waiting to be refactored and modernized for the cloud. In this tutorial, we will discuss the motivation—supported by illustrative industrial case studies—for modernizing and migrating legacy applications to cloud. We will then present a detailed tool-supported approach for transforming a monolithic Java application into microservices.

New cloud-based applications can be built from the ground up as containerized microservices, breaking a complex application into a series of smaller specialized and manageable services [1]. Efficient resource orchestration in cloud-native infrastructure is a critical challenge, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery. Kubernetes has emerged as de facto standard orchestration platform. However, its client-server architecture and storage on disk introduced latency which is not suitable for real-time communications. To address this gap, we propose DIRO (Distributed Intelligent Resource Orchestration), an orchestration platform for low latency microservices. Our proposal focus on a new scheduling architecture approach leverages in-memory data grid and distributed resource predictions to reduce scheduling delay.","","979-8-3503-0673-6","10.1109/6GNet58894.2023.10317732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10317732","Distributed Orchestration;Intelligent resource orchestration;low latency scheduling;resource prediction;distributed ranking","6G mobile communication;Microservice architectures;Distributed databases;Boosting;Real-time systems;Telecommunications;Delays","","1","","9","IEEE","20 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several commercial Samsung Network products such as Samsung Element Management System (S-EMS), 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) & Core network elements are being redesigned to fit the microservice paradigm. The cloud environment allows enterprises to scale their applications on-demand with minimum cost; however, it is often difficult to use containers without sacrificing the many benefits offered by container technology. S-EMS manages 5G RAN & Core network elements (NEs) deployed nationwide, and systematically stores a huge volume of stateful data per second. Containers are characterized to have an ephemeral state, hence ‘stateful-ness’ aspect of S-EMS makes management more complex. The existing system in a container-based application does not support geo-redundancy where services/data are stateful/state dependent. In this paper, different challenges around geo-redundancy between different independent Kubernetes set up with active and standby modes between the sites where state-dependent data is stored in each site are described. To overcome these challenges, we propose the High Availability Control Method (HACM) - which enables the Kubernetes cluster to be active and standby, where state-dependent data and context-based operations are intrinsically supported by the underlying S-EMS container application. Our approach has been designed to maintain the geo-redundancy philosophy of cloud-native by associating the status of each site using high availability (HA), switching over services based on the health of applications, deciding state when there are conflicts in site state, and the option to auto fallback based on user preference and services are transferred between sites without user intervention with optimized storage that ensures consistency, persistence, reliability, and availability. Through evaluation, we show that HACM with S-EMS can facilitate geo-redundancy HA, while not posing a significant burden on the Cloud.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3233159","Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10003198","5G networks;microservices;containers;cloud;communication networks;geo-redundancy;and high availability","Microservice architectures;Containers;5G mobile communication;Switches;Distributed databases;Synchronization;Redundancy","","1","","14","CCBY","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Models can be accurate locally, that is, for data already seen by the system and by the model identification method. However, many times an Autonomic Manager (AM) needs to move the cloud-native applications into new operational points, e.g. by adding new applications to the shared environment, scaling applications or consolidating resources. There are no data points yet for these new operational regions to have any certainty that the prediction models are accurate. In this paper, we propose a method to identify a model that predicts metrics at any unexplored operational point of a cloud-native application. The method is based on a lightweight Look-Ahead Scanner (LAS) mechanism that explores different operational points by injecting controlled short-lived load.

Although Kubernetes has already brought benefits in terms of increased scalability and flexibility to general-purpose applications, it is not natively suitable for network workloads since it lacks some functionalities required by network services. This paper presents a simple, cloud-native architecture that integrates SFCs in Kubernetes, with the aim of seamlessly leveraging cloud-native features such as horizontal autoscaling. The solution is based on flexible cross-connections, namely logical links that connect adjacent network functions, which can promptly adapt the distribution of the network traffic to the existing network functions in case of scale in/out events affecting the number of NF instances.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Enterprises are increasingly moving their production workloads to the cloud to take advantage of capabilities, such as streamlined provisioning of infrastructure and services, elasticity, scalability, reliability, and security. To leverage such capabilities, monolithic applications typically have to be decomposed to cloud-native architectures, such as microservices. A microservice encapsulates a small and well-defined set of business functionalities and interacts with other services using lightweight mechanisms, often implemented as RESTful APIs. A recent report shows that only 20% of the enterprise workloads are in the cloud, and they were predominately written for native cloud architectures. This leaves 80% of legacy applications onpremises, waiting to be refactored and modernized for the cloud. In this tutorial, we will discuss the motivation - supported by illustrative industrial case studies - for modernizing and migrating legacy applications to cloud. We will then present a detailed tool-supported approach for transforming a monolithic Java application into microservices. This will be followed by a handson virtual lab, where participants will have the opportunity to apply the learned concepts on a real-world enterprise application.

Yet, traditional approaches taken to enable stateless deployments require the operators to sacrifice on performance due to the frequent state transactions. To overcome this issue, in this paper we propose a Piggyback-based and a Proactive-Push approach which allow for procedure-aware stateless 5GC systems. Our evaluations highlight the advantages of the Piggyback approach for two synchronous control procedures, reducing their completion time by ~44% and ~70% compared to the baseline.

In this scenario, every Cloud Service Provider(CSP) ensures that they are responsible for securing the data at rest. But the data in transit is left to the user’s responsibility. Some prominent Cloud Service Providers offer services to encrypt the data in-transit as well. But under such circumstances, a copy of our enciphering keys are in any way kept under their premises which in turn is undesirable for many individual users and organizations. So, the solution is to do Client Side Encryption(CSE) to ensure the security ourselves.

Our approach integrates with existing debugging practices, making it adaptable and user-friendly. However, since C/R requires some downtime, we assess our approach’s practicality by analyzing data from 13,000 observations and estimating the time required to capture a service’s state. The minimal downtime introduced by our approach minimizes service interruption. This can be leveraged by operators to plan deployments, live debugging, maintenance, and game-day operations.

The RAN protocol stack is split into eight disaggregated options combined in three network units, i.e., Central, Distributed, and Radio. Further advances allow the RAN functions to be virtualized on top of general-purpose hardware using the virtualized RAN (vRAN). The combination of NG-RAN and vRAN results in vNG-RAN, enabling the management of the disaggregated units and protocols as a set of radio functions. However, the orchestration-based placement of these radio functions is challenging since the best decision can be determined by multiple constraints involving RAN disaggregation, crosshaul network requirements, availability of computational resources, etc. This article proposes OPlaceRAN, a vNG-RAN deployment orchestrator framed within the NFV reference architecture and aligned with the Open RAN initiative. OPlaceRAN supports the dynamic placement of radio functions focusing on vNG-RAN planning and is designed to be agnostic to the placement optimization solution. We developed a prototype based on cloud-native tools to deploy RAN using containerized virtualization and the OpenAirInterface emulator. The evaluation is analyzed considering two different approaches as a proof-of-concept. First, we applied two placement solutions in a controlled real computing infrastructure with a crosshaul network. Second, we investigated the orchestrator’s scalability with a real and larger-scale topology. Our results show that OPlaceRAN is an effective cloud-native solution for containerized network function placement and agnostic to the placement solution, handling scale-out well.

While addressing these communication challenges, implementing service mesh solutions introduces higher resource utilization, primarily due to deploying an additional per-microservice infrastructure known as the “sidecar” container. A sidecarless approach, as exemplified by Cilium, leverages extended Berkeley packet filter (eBPF) technology to minimize operational overhead and optimize resource utilization. The advent of data processing units (DPU) represents a crucial evolution in cloud accelerators, designed to offload and accelerate networking, security, and storage tasks traditionally handled by server CPUs. This demonstration integrates DPU technology with Cilium’s sidecarless architecture and proposes to offload Cilium’s control plane to DPUs. Our proposed approach improves system efficiency by deploying Cilium’s control plane components on DPUs in a separate host mode. Further, our approach conserves CPU cycles on the primary hosts and shifts network processing tasks to the DPU. This strategic offload aims to enhance throughput, reduce latency, and unburden CPUs from network processing tasks to improve the performance of service mesh architectures for cloud-native ecosystems.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-6958-8","10.1109/NetSoft60951.2024.10588912","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10588912","DPU;Cilium;eBPF;Service Mesh;Sidecar-less","Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Data processing;Throughput;Resource management;Servers;Security","","","","10","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud has given a new meaning to distributed, and off-premises computing. Although, Cloud offers great benefits, it also introduces a myriad of security threats to the information and data which is now being ported from on-premises to off-premises. Where cloud computing can help organizations accomplish more by paying less (in the longer run) and breaking the physical boundaries between IT infrastructure and its users, due to openness of accessible information and data relying on trust between cloud provider and customer, heightened security threats must be overcome in order to benefit fully from this new computing exemplar. Breach in the security of any component in the cloud can be both disaster for the organization (the customer) and defacing for the provider. This paper explores the security issues related to the cloud. The paper also discusses the existing security approaches to secure the cloud infrastructure and applications and their drawbacks. Finally, we explore some key research challenges of implementing new cloud-aware security solutions that can provide the likes of pre-emptive protection for complex and ever dynamic Cloud infrastructure, followed by conclusion where we try to entail the whole research and try to formulate a security strategy which will enable the Cloud providers and customers alike to fight against ever emerging security threats.","","978-1-4673-0126-8","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141247","Cloud;security;cloud computing;security challenges;complex distributed computing;security concerns;security strategy","Organizations;Cloud computing;Computer hacking;Standards organizations;Monitoring;Fires","","96","1","13","IEEE","30 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically a tenant will use Cloud service interfaces to acquire or release resources directly. This process can be automated by a CSP by providing auto-scaling capability where a tenant sets policies indicating under what condition resources should be auto-scaled. This is specially needed in a Cloud environment because of the huge scale at which a Cloud operates. Typical solutions are naïve causing spurious auto-scaling decisions. For example, they are based on only thresholding triggers and the thresholding mechanisms themselves are not Cloud-ready. In a Cloud, resources from three separate domains, compute, storage and network, are acquired or released on-demand. But in typical solutions resources from these three domains are not auto-scaled in an integrated fashion. Integrated auto-scaling prevents further spurious scaling and reduces the number of auto-scaling systems to be supported in a Cloud management system.

LoRa is a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) solution specifically designed for IoT devices that send and receive small amounts of data over a range of many kilometers with minimal power consumption. At the system architecture level, Lora is considered as a physical layer technology based on OSI model, mainly based on Chirp spread-spectrum(CSS) technology. LoRa is resulted in a robust and reliable technology compared to other standardized wireless solutions such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G/4G cellular. In this paper, we have designed a single-channel LoRa gateway for Industrial IoT cloud applications using inexpensive single-board computer naming Raspberry Pi plus a LoRa add-on board with the necessary integrated circuits for wireless data communication. The system adopting the LoRa LPWAN technology consists of end devices, gateways, and cloud IoT services. The proposal gateway sends and receives LoRa messages to and from end devices and communicates with upstream cloud application servers through HTTP RESTful protocol and IoT-standard MQTT protocol, according to different data types and specific functional requirements. Unlike other ready-to-use LoRa gateways available on the market in which these gateways simply pass all the original LoRa packets back and forth between and network server over the air called ""packet forwarding"" mode, the proposal gateway contains smart-agent managing connectivity to devices, coordinating polling mechanism, decoding the packets, passing periodically the unified data to the public or private cloud service applications. Aside based on the embedded web server, the configuration of the gateway is carried out through the web page with desktop or mobile application and it can be updated anytime & anywhere when necessary. The proposal gateway is built cloud ready and can easily integrate with existing networks and enables low-cost, long range communication capability for a multitude of industry applications with minimum effort.","1934-1768","978-9-8815-6390-3","10.23919/CCC50068.2020.9189480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9189480","LoRa;LoRaWAN;gateway;Industrial Internet of Things (IoT);Raspberry Pi","Logic gates;Cloud computing;Protocols;Proposals;Wireless communication;Power demand;Wireless sensor networks","","7","","19","","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the one hand, it’s difficult to achieve such flexibility within the edge-to-cloud continuum, which consists of a distributed networked ecosystem of heterogeneous computing resources. IoT traffic dynamics, on the other hand, and the growing need for low-latency services necessitate decreasing reaction time and balancing service location. For cost-effective system administration and operations, fog computing load-balancing will become a cornerstone. Though virtualization attempts to instantaneously balance the load of the overall network, there’s still the possibility of capacity excessive usage or under development. Heavily loaded systems degrade efficiency, while undercharged systems use bandwidth inefficiently. Because of inadequate load distribution, overburdened systems emit additional energy, driving up the cost of coolers as well as adding significantly to the warming of the planet. Throughout most situations, cooling towers consume higher electricity than core IT technology. Despite the benefits of cloud computing as a distributed pool of resources and services, certain new IoT applications are not cloud-ready. Wind farms and smart traffic light systems, for example, have unique characteristics and requirements “(e.g., large-scale, geo-distribution) (e.g., very low and predictable latency)”.

Several bad smells have been defined in the literature for both generic architectures and specific architectures. However, cloud-native applications based on microservices can be affected by other types of issues. In order to identify a set of microservice-specific bad smells, researchers collected evidence of bad practices by interviewing 72 developers with experience in developing systems based on microservices. Then, they classified the bad practices into a catalog of 11 microservice-specific bad smells frequently considered harmful by practitioners. The results can be used by practitioners and researchers as a guideline to avoid experiencing the same difficult situations in the systems they develop.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2018.2141031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8354414","microservice;antipattern;anti-pattern;code smell;architectural smell;bad smell;cloud computing;software development;software engineering","Interviews;Logic gates;Service computing;Software engineering;Software architecture;Cloud computing;Software development","","136","","18","IEEE","4 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The analysis of the runtime dependencies amongst the component micro-services is an essential step towards performing cloud resource management, detecting anomalous behavior of cloud applications, and meeting customer Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Finding such dependencies is challenging due to the non-linear nature of interactions, aberrant data measurements and lack of domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel use of the modeling capability of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, which excel in capturing temporal relationships in multi-variate time series data and being resilient to noisy pattern representations. Our proposed technique looks into the LSTM model structure, to uncover dependencies amongst performance metrics, which were learned during training. We further apply this technique in three monitoring use cases, namely finding the strongest performance predictors, discovering lagged/temporal dependencies, and improving the accuracy of forecasting for a given metric. We demonstrate the viability of our approach, by comparing the results of our proposed method in the three use cases with those obtained from previously proposed methods, such as Granger causality and the classical statistical time series analysis models, such as ARIMA and Holt-Winters. For our experiments and analysis, we use performance monitoring data collected from two sources: a controlled experiment involving a sample cloud application that we deployed in a public cloud infrastructure and cloud monitoring data collected from the monitoring service of an operational, public cloud service provider.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258087","Big Data;Machine Learning;Statistical learning;Supervised learning;Time series analysis;Neural networks","Portable document format","","12","","","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large body of research has deployed automatic resource allocation algorithms using reactive and proactive autoscaling policies. However, there is still a gap in the efficiency of current algorithms in capturing the important features of microservices from their architecture and deployment environment, for example, lack of consideration of graphical dependency. To address this challenge, we propose Graph-PHPA, a graph-based proactive horizontal pod autoscaling strategy for allocating cloud resources to microservices leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) and graph neural network (GNN) based prediction methods. We evaluate the performance of Graph-PHPA using the Bookinfo microservices deployed in a dedicated testing environment with real-time workloads generated based on realistic datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of Graph-PHPA by comparing it with the rule-based resource allocation scheme in Kubernetes as our baseline.

Accordingly, new implementations of telecom standards, such as the 3GPP 5G Core, are defined as fully-virtualized infrastructures consisting of different components and leveraging a cloud-native approach. At the same time, standard-oriented solutions, such as ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO), have emerged to master the complexity of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) orchestration, including 5G Core VNFs. While MANO operates at the NFV level, it also leverages existing cloud infrastructures for the deployment of VNFs by interoperating with resource orchestrators at the cloud level. From the business perspective, that requires telco operators to interact with different technology providers, from NFV/MANO software producers to cloud computing providers, and to hire technicians proficient in the technologies of both telco and computing worlds, that are a rather difficult human resourcing to find. The main claim of the article is that the Development and Operations (DevOps) tools in the IT world are mature enough to leverage them directly in the telco world, without superimposing other interlaced standard/software. That allows to significantly reduce OPEX cost of complex telco infrastructures by supporting all needed automation and by avoiding the combined use of (too) complex layered standards/software stacks, such as in the case of MANO. Accordingly, in this article, we leverage container-based technologies and Kubernetes to design and evaluate a novel deployment approach, called 5G-Kube, for softwarized 5G core networks. 5G-Kube, which is openly to the community, has been also evaluated in two different use cases of the 5G Core and Kubernetes deployment fitting, namely, Industry 4.0 and Smart Cities.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.006.2200693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10082862","","5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Servers;Microservice architectures;Hardware;Network function virtualization;Software defined networking;Smart cities;Fourth Industrial Revolution;3GPP;Performance evaluation","","5","","15","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the execution of these Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) in general purpose hardware brings slower performance and higher energy consumption. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a promising solution to improve performance and energy consumption thanks to their reconfigurable fabric and acceleration capabilities. These capabilities are in general made available to computing systems through the PCIe bus and the SR-IOV technology that enables a single PCIe device to offer multiple virtual interfaces (Virtual Functions or VFs) to the applications (or VMs). This brings static allocation of FPGA portions to each virtual machine, achieving best acceleration performance given by the direct communication of guests application with the FPGA fabric. Despite that, SR-IOV has a strong impact on the FPGA resources usage. In fact, the number of available VFs (i.e., interfaces for connection to the VMs) is limited in number and flexibility. This is a problem, especially in containerized or cloud native environments where several thousands of guests need to be run concurrently. In addition, static assignment of FPGA resources might not always be the best strategy, especially when the VNFs that are attached to VFs underutilize the FPGA resource. In that case, a VNF that rarely uses the FPGA prevents a new VNF from accessing the accelerators. This paper aims to address these limitations by assigning one FPGA's VF to multiple VNFs. To do this, we extended the SR-IOV based acceleration framework FPGA Virtualization Manager (vFPGAmanager) with VF sharing feature. The CPU-FPGA throughput performance of two containers using different hardware accelerators through the same VF has been measured. The results show a penalty of 30% when two VNFs request acceleration at the same time (worst case scenario). In the best case (i.e., when the VNFs don't concurrently request FPGA acceleration) close to native performance is achieved.","2575-4912","978-1-7281-0546-8","10.1109/EuCNC.2019.8802043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802043","","","","4","","19","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The central idea is an online available software-as-a-service application that analyzes, persists, and visualizes software applications which users intend to explore and comprehend via software visualization. The resulting implementation is a redevelopment of our live trace visualization tool Explor Viz. In comparison to other approaches, ExplorViz utilizes WebGL and other browser technologies instead of a game engine to render its visualizations. As a result, we achieve a platform-independent interoperability that is crucial for (remote) collaboration. Here, users can explore the same visualization via our collaboratively usable desktop, virtual reality, and also augmented reality modes. Our prototype follows the Twelve-Factor App methodology to build a cloud-native application that comprises multiple scalable microservices. Thanks to horizontal scaling, our implementation is capable to analyze a large amount of visualization data; thus, allowing multiple users to simultaneously use the software visualization service.

The state of the art architecture and evolution of the cloud at that time was already increasing datacenter complexity by piling up new layers of management over the many layers that already exist. Since then, the scale of distributed applications and their management have taken a new dimension demanding tolerance to wild fluctuations both in workloads and available computing resource pools. There are many calls to go cloud native and architect applications using the many services provided by the cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services. On the other hand, there are also calls for avoiding vendor lock-in by going multi-cloud and becoming cloud agnostic. In this conference there is a new paper that proposes cloud agnostic approach with globally interoperable cloud network using private or public network while reducing the complexity of Virtual machine image motion across clouds. In addition, there are 7 papers describing advances in current distributed and cloud computing practices dealing with quality of service, adaptive algorithms and software defined network architectures.","","978-1-5386-1759-5","10.1109/WETICE.2017.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003795","Cloud Computing;grid computing;Distributed Intelligent Managed Element Networks;Distributed Services Management;Services Virtualization;Parallel Computing","Cloud computing;Business;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Conferences;Collaboration","","2","","16","IEEE","10 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the technology is constantly changing at a very high pace, improving and modifying with each development, there is a constant need of is faster and more frequent delivery of the software and applications. Today, most software and applications are built in such a way that they could run across multiple operating environments. Software development is performed using agile principles and the most critical part of it is Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration (CI/CD). CI/CD aims at automating the process of testing, building, and deploying the commitments made by the developer to the code repository. The use of Container-based applications solves a number of complex problems that are found on CI/CD such as portability, elasticity, visibility, and version control. This modular approach enables a simpler, faster, more secure, and more efficient way of development by more focused teams responsible for specific containers. In this context, a new point of interest in the development process, GitOps, which is more agile, reliable, fast, and efficient in its approach towards better performance levels with cloud-native.

This paper presents a new orchestration system called Karamel that addresses these challenges by providing a cloud-independent orchestration service for deploying and configuring cloud applications and platforms across different environments. In Karamel, we model configuration routines with their dependencies in composable modules, and we achieve a high level of configuration/deployment parallelism by using techniques such as DAG traversal control logic, dataflow variable binding, and parallel actuation. In Karamel, complex distributed deployments are specified declaratively in a compact YAML syntax, and cluster definitions can be validated using an external artifact repository (GitHub).","2159-6190","978-1-7281-2705-7","10.1109/CLOUD.2019.00069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8814511","cloud;software deployment;orchestration;IaaS;provisioning","","","2","","21","IEEE","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing services proffer the ability to spin up and spin down clusters based on the load, provide various version support, cloud native tools, hardware and software capabilities. However, cloud based migration pose securitychallenges due to reliance on multiple, potentially third partyclouds.Migration is of six types known as the 6Rs viz. a) Lift and shift, b) Refactoring, c) Re-platforming, d) Re-purchasing, e) Retiring and f) Retaining. In Lift and shift, one simply “liff”s or copies applications, workloads, or databases from on premises to the cloud with no changes. Refactoring is also known as rearchitecting, which usually deals with modifying applications. Based on resource consumption and business needs, refactoring is usually favoured along with the first approach, but this is time consuming and expensive compared to the former. In replatforming though, optimizations along with few infrastructure changes are done, to avail all the benefits of the respective target cloud offerings.In this paper, we discuss few migration use cases at Walmart, all centred around the second and the third migration strategies and discuss the solution approaches, which resulted in remarkable gains.","","978-1-6654-6582-3","10.1109/BCD54882.2022.9900725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900725","Cloud migration;Refactoring;Re-platforming;Teradata;BigQuery;Microsoft Azure;Google Cloud Platform.","Cloud computing;Databases;Scalability;Pipelines;Companies;Maintenance engineering;Software","","2","","15","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For cloud service providers, accurate container workload prediction can contribute to the improvement of resource utilization and service level agreement. However, containers that support different sorts of businesses have different preferences on resource requirements, and thus the prediction methods via one general model cannot work for all containers. In this paper, we propose a novel workload prediction method to adapt to different classes of containers and obtain more accurate prediction results. We first develop an automatic classifier to classify the containers according to their resource usage records. For each type of container, we train an attention mechanism-based Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) model to predict the workload. Then a weight optimizer and the trained LSTM models are assembled into an ensemble predictor. The proposed weight optimizer can dynamically update weights according to the real-time container workload. Experiments on the Google cluster-data dataset show that the accuracy of our ensemble predictor is 7% higher than that of other two competitive methods.","","978-1-6654-0745-8","10.1109/CBD54617.2021.00011","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816184","Workload Prediction;Automatic Classification;Attention-based LSTM;Ensemble Predictor","Adaptation models;Containers;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Data models;Internet","","1","","15","IEEE","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This makes it suitable to be used in standalone way as a blood pressure monitoring device with wireless data transmission capabilities, or to be integrated in more complex telemedicine systems. The resulted unit has been designed to be used mostly with patients having neuromotor disabilities that cannot move around their homes and need specialized care by permanently measuring their blood pressure. In this way the new blood pressure device is capable to automatically initiate the blood pressure measurements and, after the measurement has been performed, to forward the values of systolic and diastolic pressures along with heart rates through a bridge and a gateway to a cloud native database storage, for storing and further processing. The gateway is responsible also for interfacing with other non-medical smart home devices such as environmental sensors and/or other actuators for home automation. On the other side of the cloud, the clinicians can easily connect to the database and retrieve all the information related to the registered patients and their recorded physiological parameters. The resulted system has also a medical alert feature in case of measured blood pressure is beyond the prescribed limits at the gateway level. The new developed device has been tested with 10 healthy subjects having the blood pressure within the normal limits, and then they simulate pathological values.

However, microservices design is not a trivial task, which highly depends on the profound knowledge and experience of system design and target domain. This is a challenge for novice software architects. In this paper, we propose a microservices design tool named RapidMS, which only requires architects to specify potential context boundaries on the requirements model. The microservices architecture design model with component structure and interaction views can be automatically generated without extra human effort. Moreover, the proposed tool can automatically calculate the characteristic metrics of the microservices, which indicate the quality of the different aspects of models to support rapid architecture refinements. We demonstrate the tool's effectiveness through five case studies. The experimental result shows that architects can get better decomposition of requirement model within four iterations and over 90% of microservice architecture diagrams can be correctly generated within 10 seconds. RapidMS can be further extended and applied in the software industry to reduce the cost and difficulty of microservices decomposition and design.

In parallel, another trend, with containerization technologies (e.g., Docker), has taken a serious hold on cloud-scale data centers, with direct implications on building next generation of data center applications. Container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes) have made deployment a lot easy, and they solve many infrastructure level problems, e.g., service discovery, auto-restart, and replication. For best in class performance, there is a need to marry the next generation applications with containerization technologies. To that end, CRA leverages and builds upon the containerization and resource orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes/Docker, and makes it easy to build a wide range of cloud-edge applications on top.

The utility of serverless and its difference from traditional computing frameworks is explored by performing high-dimensional matrix operations with serverless technology provided by cloud providers. In this paper, the efficiency and infect factors of high-dimensional matrix multiplication and convolution are validated. It is found that the execution time and computation time of functions vary with matrix size, CPU, and convolution kernel when performing matrix multiplication and convolution operations. The parallel operation is significantly more efficient when performing matrix multiplication. The efficiency of serverless operations can be optimized by selecting the appropriate CPU and other variables and decomposing tasks for parallel execution to avoid resource competition.","","979-8-3503-1373-4","10.1109/ICSECE58870.2023.10263453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10263453","High-dimensional matrix;matrix multiplication;matrix convolution;serverless","Computers;Cloud computing;Convolution;Market research;Software;Central Processing Unit;Sensors","","","","10","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure a certain performance level, specific network conditions must be met (we focus on the SFC end-to-end delay bound). Likewise, to guarantee availability, resilient schemes must be introduced to keep the SFC operational even in the presence of faults (we focus on the so-called five nines availability). To automate the SFC performability management, we have designed a REST-compliant framework useful to build an SFC that meets performability requirements while minimizing deployment cost. We adopt an M / G / k queueing model to deal with performance aspects, and Stochastic Reward Networks (SRN) to face availability issues of SFCs.

This method is designed to reduce cold start occurrences by pre-starting functions based on predicted demand. Experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of this approach. The methodology includes collecting historical request data, preprocessing, parameter determination, and model training. The SARIMA model is employed for predictions, allowing for dynamic resource allocation in response to predicted demand, significantly reducing cold start times and resource wastage compared to traditional static threshold-based methods.

One limiting factor in the realization of edge-cloud automation systems (ECASs) lies in its operation mode over the network. This may result in tangible delays between the industrial process and the edge-cloud. This paper analyzes how the network delay affects the process performance of an industrial machine on the base of the real-time requirements of the control functions hosted in the edge-cloud. For this purpose, two potential scenarios for the migration of the control system of a real machine to the edge-cloud are implemented. Each scenario features the offloading of more real-time critical control functions to the edge-cloud, which is then tested under increasing load on the network. The study derives classes of automation functions according to the real-time requirements of a potential offloading to the edge-cloud. Furthermore, it shows how complementary designs of an ECAS can affect the performance of the automated systems. In this sense, the results reveal that firm real-time functions can be offloaded to the edge-cloud without any significant loss of performance even if non-real-time networking components are used. On the base of these results, potentials applications domains of ECASs are discussed prospectively and future work is proposed.","2161-8089","979-8-3503-2069-5","10.1109/CASE56687.2023.10260306","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260306","","Automation;Limiting;Costs;Scalability;Process control;Control systems;Real-time systems","","","","15","IEEE","28 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, growing interest of vendor neutrality and interoperability from vendors and operators, requires standardisation of well-defined interfaces. In this paper, we propose an abstraction layer for the disaggregation of a broadband network gateway (BNG).

In this paper, we propose an observability library and an observability platform that addresses this problem and generates alerts that precisely point to fault locations. Logs at multiple layers are tagged with a common request identifier that helps in performing correlation. The observability platform is architected such that it lends itself to extensions to catch multiple types of errors and issues.

When these network functions run inside a container, these software instances are often known as Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNF). Network providers use VNFs with different functionality in a chain to provide a service to the end user. A set of ordered VNFs is termed a Service Function Chain (SFC). The problem of placing and chaining VNFs of an SFC onto a network topology to minimize a cost function is known as SFC Placement and Chaining. This paper demonstrates how to solve the problem of SFC placement and chaining in a container-based environment. Multiple CNFs are used to create multiple service chains. These SFC have deployed on the National Scientific Foundation Network (NSFNET) topology. The SFC path is calculated using the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. We have selected end-to-end delay and operational cost as the cost function that is minimized using the ACO algorithm. Performance metrics like end-to-end delay, operational cost, and throughput are recorded. We compare these results to the mathematical model to prove that the experimental and theoretical values are coherent with one another. These results benefit the network operators to do a cost-benefit analysis using the theoretical method, without wasting their time and resources on setting up a full-scale experimental setup.","","978-1-6654-5582-4","10.1109/ICCTech57499.2023.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10361368","software-defined networking;network function virtualization;virtual network functions;service function chain;SFC placement and chaining;container","Network topology;Service function chaining;Containers;Cost function;Throughput;Virtual machining;Software","","","","18","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Containerised Network Functions (CNFs) can be hosted directly on the server’s host OS- Bare Metal (BM)- or can run inside a Virtual Machine (VM). The choice of BM or VM to host containers depends on many factors linked to security, tenant isolation, available resources and performance. This paper explores this important consideration by conducting comparative tests in a specific domain, namely at the network edge where resources are tightly constrained. Using a small form-factor micro server, we demonstrate how BM can clearly out-perform the use of a VM but that this occurs when there are distinct set-up dependencies around small fixed frame sizes and very stringent packet loss constraints. The performance margin is notably shrunk however, when a more realistic traffic load is used and non-zero packet loss permitted: the VM performance reaches within 89% of the BM throughput, while also achieving an average latency 14% lower than the BM setup. These results emphasise it is not simply a clear-cut case of BM always being “better”, with many other factors requiring attention including security and tenant isolation. We use the insights gleaned from lab testing alongside qualitative criteria to better inform design decisions around using VMs or BM to host CNFs.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175415","Network Performance;CNFs;VMs;Edge Compute","Cloud computing;Packet loss;Metals;Telecommunication traffic;Containers;Throughput;Virtual machining","","","","17","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, an organization that drives adoption of the cloud‐native programming paradigm, focuses on container and microservice technologies. In order to create a more feature‐rich application, some SaaS vendors have turned their application into a platform upon which partners and independent software vendors (ISVs) can build applications that extend the SaaS platform. Partners and ISVs can be broken into two general categories: smaller startups and larger, established companies.

The situation is challenging when the model is deployed in a cloud-based infrastructure. To address this issue, a cloud-native development methodology called serverless infrastructure enables developers to create and execute applications without having to worry about managing servers. Generally, traditional systems require manual scaling, constant maintenance, and dedicated hardware resulting in high costs. To solve this, the AI model is deployed in serverless infrastructure services for hosting APIs that is to identify marine animals which have the potential to attack human beings at the seashores. The serverless infrastructure suffers from an initializing delay called cold start for occasional requests and hence the response time will be delayed even if the lambda function is free. The problem of cold starts is mitigated using the scheduler in the lambda function. The scheduler sends dummy requests to the server to keep the server warm and active. The AI model used as a test case utilizes Convolutional Neural Network Algorithms and Transfer Learning Technique, for detecting predators near the seashore. The model is deployed in a serverless infrastructure and has the benefits of automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and decreased operational costs. The AI model is implemented in both serverless infrastructure and in Elastic Cloud Compute EC2. The performance of both systems was done for cost, latency, and response time. The proposed system provides promising results when compared to traditional server systems.","2767-7788","979-8-3503-9849-6","10.1109/ICICT57646.2023.10134379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10134379","Application Programming Interface (API);Cloud computing;Serverless infrastructure;Image classification;Artificial intelligence;Lambda function;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Transfer learning","Costs;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Neural networks;Pricing;Manuals;Time factors","","","","15","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A possible approach to solve this would be a cloud-native network, upon which containerized network functions could be deployed: this is why Kubernetes is gaining attention among network software vendors and service providers. Kubernetes has become the de-facto industry standard for orchestrating containerized resources at real-life scales. However, Kubernetes ’s abilities might seem to be limited. Currently, it lacks the toolset for advanced L2/L3 level networking, which would be essential, for example, in the case of IPv6-based mobility management. Furthermore, many types of software architectures can be envisioned on the top of Kubernetes which may have different impacts on performance.

However, despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the security of an open-ended and rather freely accessible resource is still questionable which impacts the cloud adoption. The security problem becomes amplified under the cloud model as new dimensions enter into the problem scope related to the architecture, multi-tenancy, layer dependency, and elasticity. This paper introduces a detailed analysis of the cloud security problem. It investigates the problem of security from the cloud architecture perspective, the cloud characteristics perspective, cloud delivery model perspective, and the cloud stakeholder perspective. The paper investigates some of the key research challenges of implementing cloud-aware security solutions which can plausibly secure the ever-changing and dynamic cloud model.

Deep-learning-based cloud removal from RS imagery has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, it remains challenging to exploit useful multiscale cloud-aware representations from cloud imagery due to the lack of effective modeling of cloud distortion effects and the weak feature representation capabilities of networks. To circumvent these challenges, we propose a multiscale distortion-aware cloud removal (MSDA-CR) network consisting of multiple cloud-distortion-aware representation learning (CDARL) modules combined in a multiscale grid architecture. Specifically, cloud distortion control functions (CDCFs) are defined and incorporated into the CDARL modules to adaptively model the distortion effects induced by cloud interference in the imaging process, with learnable parameters for the exploitation of distortion-restored representations. These representations are further distilled across different scales in the MSDA-CR network and integrated based on an attention mechanism to restore cloud-free images while retaining the spatial structures of ground objects. Extensive experiments on visible and multispectral RS datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MSDA-CR network.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3144686","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801323); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682038); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee(grant numbers:JCYJ20190813170803617); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686746","Cloud distortion;cloud removal;deep learning;image restoration;remote sensing (RS)","Clouds;Cloud computing;Distortion;Land surface;Feature extraction;Image restoration;Atmospheric modeling","","12","","11","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From physical space, cold-boot attacks and DMA attacks impose a great threat to the unattended devices. In this paper, we propose TrustShadow that provides a comprehensively protected execution environment for unmodified application running on ARM-based IoT devices. To defeat cyber attacks, TrustShadow takes advantage of ARM TrustZone technology and partitions resources into the secure and normal worlds. In the secure world, TrustShadow constructs a trusted execution environment for security-critical applications. This trusted environment is maintained by a lightweight runtime system. The runtime system does not provide system services itself. Rather, it forwards them to the untrusted normal-world OS, and verifies the returns. The runtime system further employs a page based encryption mechanism to ensure that all the data segments of a security-critical application appear in ciphertext in DRAM chip.

Its aim is to provide cloud aware network infrastructure to power and support modern data intensive research at European universities and research organisations. The paper describes the OCX concept, architecture, design and implementation options. OCX includes 3 major components: distributed L0-L2 (optionally L3) network infrastructure that includes OCX points of presence (OCXP) interconnected with GEANT backbone; the Trusted Third Party (TTP) for building dynamic trust federations; and the marketplace to enable publishing and discovery of cloud services. OCX intends to be neutral to actual cloud services provisioning and limits its services to Layer 0 through Layer 2 in order to remain transparent to current cloud services model. The recent developments include an architectural update, API definition, integration with higher-level applications and workflow control, signaling and intercloud topology modelling and visualization. The paper reports about results and experiences learnt from the recent OCX demonstrations at the SC14 Exhibition in November 2014 that demonstrated the benefits of an OCX enabled Intercloud infrastructure for running data intensive real-time cloud applications on top of the advanced GEANT multi-gigabit network. The implemented OCX functionality allowed applications to control the network path for data transfer and service delivery connectivity between multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). It was used in combination with a multi-cloud workflow management and planning application (Vampire) that enables data processing performance monitoring and migration of VMs and processes to an alternative location based on performance predictions.","","978-1-4799-8218-9","10.1109/IC2E.2015.84","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092963","Open Cloud eXchange (OCX); Intercloud Architecture Framework (ICAF); Intercloud Federations Framework; Vampire Application Workflow Management/Optimisation System; Intercloud Network Infrastructure Monitoring and Visualisation; Cloud Services Marketplace","Cloud computing;Topology;Network topology;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Communities","","6","1","34","IEEE","23 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This addresses the longstanding problem of safely executing high assurance computations on untrusted hosts. Untrusted computations are instrumented with a check pointing mechanism that yields a proof of computation integrity as the computation progresses. This proof can be validated by a trusted cloud to ensure that the computation was carried out faithfully. Cloud parallelism and replication is leveraged to validate the proof efficiently even when the original computation is not parallel zed. This affords a means of high-assurance, serial computation on cloud-aware, mobile devices that mix resource-rich but untrusted hardware with trusted but comparatively resource-impoverished hardware components. An implementation for Java and Hadoop MapReduce demonstrates that the approach is effective for commodity VMs, clouds, and software.","","978-0-7695-4996-5","10.1109/CCGrid.2013.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546123","result checking;computation integrity;software security;cloud computing;Hadoop MapReduce","Software;Hardware;Java;Mobile communication;Semantics;Parallel processing;Mobile handsets","","5","","42","IEEE","24 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this challenge has come to find a solution through cloud computing, there are still few devices and operating systems that enable applications execution by only uploading the required components into the runtime environment. The ROCS (Remote OSGi Caching Service) framework is a novel proposal which relies on a heavy-weighted standard Java/OSGi stack. It is distributed between class servers and ambient devices to provide full functionalities to resource-constrained environments. The ROCS framework provides improvements in two areas. First, it defines a minimal bootstrap environment that runs a standard Java/OSGi stack. Secondly, it provides an architecture for loading any necessary missing class from remote servers into memory at runtime. Our first results show similar performances when classes are either remotely downloaded into the main memory from a local network or from a flash drive. These results suggest a way to design minimalistic middleware that dynamically obtain their applications from the network as a first step towards cloud-aware operating systems.","2374-9709","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488475","","Java;Operating systems;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Runtime environment;Informatics;Laboratories;Safety;Computer architecture;Proposals","","4","","15","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing methods such as Serial Evaluation and Consequential Choice etc. are inadequate as they fail to capture the objective measurement of various criteria that are important for evaluating the platform alternatives. In practice, these methods are applied in an ad-hoc fashion. In this paper we introduce three application development platforms: 1) Traditional non-cloud 2) Virtualized and 3) Cloud Aware. We propose a systematic method that allows the stakeholders to evaluate these platforms so as to select the optimal one by considering important criteria. We apply our evaluation method to these platforms by considering a certain (non-business) set of NFQAs.

In this paper, the integration of IMS in cloud environment is addressed from cloud-aware IMS provider, and IMS-aware cloud provider perspectives. From the IMS-aware cloud point of view, a new Virtual Machine (VM) placement algorithm is presented that considers the structure of IMS elements and the links among them. Current VM placement algorithms in data centers do not take into account communication structure of deployed VMs that may cause extra delay between IMS components. Subsequently, the quality of IMS services may degrade, especially when scalability is provided through provisioning of redundant IMS elements. Our proposed VM placement algorithm considers the structure and communication patterns of IMS elements in order to improve service quality of IMS provider while preserving cloud providers resource management policy. The simulation results obtained through Cloudsim simulator show the superiority of the algorithm presented in this study over non IMS-aware VM placement algorithms in Cloud data centers in terms of IMS service delay.","2330-2186","978-1-5386-7899-2","10.1109/CloudCom2018.2018.00069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591038","cloud-Environment,-IP-Multimedia-Subsystem,-VM-Placement,-Network-Function-Virtualization","Cloud computing;Quality of service;Delays;Resource management;Computer architecture;Virtual machining;Scalability","","1","","34","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, current elasticity strategies usually focus on IaaS resources without taking into account what is running on VMs (Virtual Machines), leading to issues such as inaccurate elasticity and resource over-provisioning. This paper proposes an automatic management of elasticity that allows a fine grained elasticity by either replicating application's components on existing underused VMs or replicating VMs. Elasticity management is also integrated into CaMid, a cloud-aware middleware for distributed objects. An experimental evaluation was carried out to assess the overhead caused by the elasticity management on the application performance. This approach has three key benefits: elasticity transparency for developers, rationalizes the use of virtual resources and improves the application's performance.","","978-1-5386-1629-1","10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024614","Cloud computing;elasticity;middleware","Elasticity;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Observers;Computer architecture;Time factors","","","","17","IEEE","4 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the spectral information available in ground-to-sky data is limited. Therefore, extracting features with strong discrimination from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is challenging. Currently, deep-learning-based cloud detection methods face two main challenges. First, although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively extract high-frequency (HF) components from images through convolutions, they struggle to capture low-frequency (LF) components, which are capable of representing global features and target structures. Second, in ORSIs, the spectral characteristics of thin clouds and the sky are similar, making it difficult to distinguish cloud regions from the background. To address these challenges, we propose a network consisting of two main modules: the mixer module (MM) and the cloud-aware attention module (CAAM). The MM comprises an HF and an LF components extraction branch. The HF branch extracts local textures through max-pooling and parallel convolution operations. The LF branch captures long-range dependency by decomposing a large kernel convolution. It leverages the advantages of both convolution and self-attention to effectively capture global features. In addition, we introduce the CAAM, which quantifies images into histograms to separate clouds from the background and enhances the perception of clouds using an attention mechanism. We conducted experiments using both daytime and nighttime cloud image data from the SWINySeg dataset with mIoU reaching 88.93% and overall accuracy (OA) reaching 93.97%. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art cloud detection methods.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2024.3381755","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62372284,62202283); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10478900","Attention mechanism;cloud detection;deep learning","Clouds;Feature extraction;Hafnium;Mixers;Kernel;Histograms;Image color analysis","","","","20","IEEE","26 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, computation workstations suited for deep learning are usually equipped with multiple GPUs allowing for workload distribution among multiple GPUs for larger datasets while exploiting parallelism in each GPU. In this paper, we utilize distributed and parallel computation techniques to efficiently analyze healthcare data using deep learning techniques. We demonstrate the scalability and computational benefits of this approach with a case study of longitudinal assessment of approximately 150 000 type 2 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the fourth case of mortality worldwide with rising prevalence. T2DM leads to adverse events such as acute myocardial infarction, major amputations, and avoidable hospitalizations. This paper aims to establish a relation between laboratory and medical assessment variables with the occurrence of the aforementioned adverse events and its prediction using machine learning techniques. We use a raw database provided by Basque Health Service, Spain, to conduct this study. This database contains 150 156 patients diagnosed with T2DM, from whom 321 laboratory and medical assessment variables recorded over four years are available. Predictions of adverse events on T2DM patients using both classical machine learning and deep learning techniques were performed and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as metrics. The best performance for the prediction of acute myocardial infarction is obtained by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) both balanced and weight models with an accuracy of 97%; hospital admission for avoidable causes best performance is obtained by LDA balanced and SVMs balanced both with an accuracy of 92%. For the prediction of the incidence of at least one adverse event, the model with the best performance is the recurrent neural network trained with a balanced dataset with an accuracy of 94.6%. The ability to perform and compare these experiments was possible through the use of a workstation with multi-GPUs. This setup allows for scalability to larger datasets. Such models are also cloud ready and can be deployed on similar architectures hosted on AWS for even larger datasets.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2919168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723173","Deep learning;graphics processing unit (GPU) computing;healthcare","Diabetes;Databases;Diseases;Deep learning;Medical diagnostic imaging","","34","","30","IEEE","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, to simplify the system operation and maintenance as well as to reduce costs, WSNs mus become an infrastructure that is capable of providing services to multiple end users concurrently, rather than having to roll out individual infrastructures for specific purposes. Here, we present the concept of a WSN infrastructure as a WSN Cloud, which provides services to multiple application and data collection systems which adheres to the cloud computing paradigm. Each instance of the WSN Cloud (i.e. a specific set of services configured by a particular end user/system) utilises the WSN infrastructure as if it was a unique network provisioned for their specific requirements. This realisation of the WSN Cloud as Network as a Service or NaaS requires the WSN to support a service orientated software architecture allowing other systems to provision the WSN infrastructure for their needs with NaaS allowing multiple systems to use the WSN uniquely and concurrently. The WSN-Service Orchestration Architecture ""WSN-SOrA"" presented here is a novel approach to orchestrate service provisioning for embedded networked systems, and enables WSNs to act as cloud ready infrastructures that facilitate on-demand provisioning for potentially multiple individual backend systems.","2159-6190","978-1-4673-2892-0","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253607","WSN Cloud;Service Orchestration;IaaS","Wireless sensor networks;Engines;Logic gates;Service oriented architecture;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Energy management","","16","3","27","IEEE","2 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The low cost of cloud computing and its dynamic scaling renders it an innovation driver for small companies, particularly in the developing world. Cloud deployed enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management applications (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM) applications, medical applications and mobile applications have potential to reach millions of users. Cloud deployed applications that employ mobile devices as end-points are particularly exciting due to the high penetration of mobile devices in countries like China, South Africa and India. With the opportunities in cloud computing being greater than at any other time in history, we had to pause and reflect on our own experiences with cloud computing - both as producers and consumers of that technology. Our interests and attitudes toward cloud technology differ considerably for each side of the cloud-computing topic. As producers of cloud-like infrastructure, much of our interest was on the technology itself. We experimented with algorithms for managing remote program invocation, fault tolerance, dynamic load balancing, proactive resource management and meaningful distributed application monitoring. As consumers of cloud computing however, our focus switched from interesting technology to usability, simplicity, reliability and guaranteed rock solid data stability. With an eye to the many cloud articles in the recent news, we have to ask, is cloud computing ready for prime time? After reviewing stories about current cloud deployments, we conclude that cloud computing is not yet ready for general use, many significant cloud service failures have been reported and several important issues remain unaddressed. Furthermore, besides the failures and gaps in the current cloud offerings, there is an inherent flaw in the model itself. Today, the cloud represents an opportunity for a client to outsource hardware/software function or program computing cycles. The missing piece is responsibility outsourcing - today something found only in IT Outsourcing contracts. This missing piece represents an essential component of a cloud offering. Without it, cloud consumers are left without any real reassurances that their data is safe from failures, catastrophe or court ordered search and seizure. In this paper, we explore the different viewpoints of cloud computing. Leveraging our experiences on both sides of clouds, we examine clouds from a technology aspect, a service aspect and a responsibility aspect. We highlight some of the opportunities in cloud computing, underlining the importance of clouds and showing why that technology must succeed. Finally, we propose some usability changes for cloud computing that we feel are needed to make clouds ready for prime time.","2166-0786","978-1-61284-415-2","10.1109/SRII.2011.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958106","clouds;cloud computing;responsibility outsourcing;mobile computing","Cloud computing;Clouds;Contracts;Usability;Hardware;Law","","9","","34","IEEE","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach automatically modifies the source code of an application before the migration, to make it cloud-ready, and then transforms the source code to the target code in the cloud environment. The approach is supported by three key elements (patterns, rules and templates) and a process that systematically applies these elements. First, a pattern matching engine based on a regular expression processing technique is used to identify the parts of the source code that require modification and to extract the essential tokens from the source code for code transformation. Next, transformation rules are invoked to change the source code into the target code using a template, designed according to the target cloud environment. The proposed approach has been demonstrated on 19 open-source projects, by migrating them to Amazon Web Services.","2159-6190","978-1-4673-7287-9","10.1109/CLOUD.2015.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214025","cloud computing;cloud migration;pattern-based code transformation;transformation rule;AWS","Pattern matching;Cloud computing;Transforms;Databases;Syntactics;Java;Security","","8","2","21","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, as a potential channel of accessing personal information, these specialized applications also expose the public sector to new risks. The cybersecurity landscape is changing, and Local Public Administrations are rapidly becoming an attractive target for cybercriminals, who might access some sets of personal data or gain control over smartly operated city resources through LPAs infrastructures. The consequences of cyber-threats have the potential to be considerable causing business interruptions, data losses, and thefts of intellectual property, significantly impacting both individuals and organizations.

To cope with exploding hardware requirements it can become indispensable to tackle such simulations in a divide and conquer manner. A promising approach breaking down a simulation scenario in a set of small tasks is the spatial subdivision of the simulated area. Thereby, each spatial sector is simulated by a dedicated sub-simulator enabling efficient distribution of the overall simulation across multiple machines. However, a distributable and easy-to-use simulation solution providing automated scalability and hiding the distribution complexity from the simulation engineer requires a service-based simulator architecture equipped with interfaces for simulation control, integration, and resource management. In this work, building upon previous results we propose a cloud-ready simulation infrastructure providing automotive engineers with the ability to analyze large scale connected traffic scenarios without caring about the execution environment. As a consequence, the proposed solution can be integrated seamlessly into existing continuous integration environments supporting agile research and development processes for cooperatively interacting vehicles.","","978-1-7281-5125-0","10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8904542","simulation as a service, cooperative vehicles, model-driven engineering, testing","","","7","","33","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this need, cloud computing provides semiconductor and electronics companies with instant access to scalable compute resources. However, deploying electronic design automation (EDA) jobs on the cloud requires EDA teams to deeply understand the characteristics of their jobs in cloud environments. Unfortunately, there has been little to no public information on these characteristics. Thus, in this article, we first formulate the problem of moving EDA jobs to the cloud. To address the problem, we characterize the performance of four EDA main applications, namely: 1) synthesis; 2) placement; 3) routing; and 4) static timing analysis. We show that different EDA jobs require different compute configurations in order to achieve the best performance. Using observations from our characterization, we propose a novel model based on graph convolutional networks to predict the total runtime of a given stage on different configurations. Our model achieves a prediction accuracy of 87%. Furthermore, we present a new formulation for optimizing cloud deployments in order to reduce costs while meeting deadline constraints. We present a pseudopolynomial optimal solution using a multichoice knapsack mapping that reduces deployment costs by 35.29%, with minimal overhead to the total runtime. In addition, we describe a cloud-ready solution, called EDA analytics central, for the continuous optimization of a design across an EDA flow. We used this system in building our runtime prediction model.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2021.3120534","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:1814920); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576518","Cloud computing;electronic design automation (EDA);graph neural networks","Cloud computing;Costs;Virtual machining;Runtime;Hardware;Software as a service;Predictive models","","5","","41","IEEE","15 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increasing distributed nature of the transformed system, new challenges for data consistency and deployment arise, which can be counteracted by the integration of microservices patterns. However, the use of such patterns is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a case study of a migration process of the learning management system Artemis which consists of two phases. The first phase shows the transformation from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture with a shared database. It sets as a goal the identification of microservice boundaries, the decomposition of the monolith application into multiple distributed entities, as well as their orchestration in a cloud-ready environment. The second phase migrates the shared database into multiple databases based on the database-per-microservice pattern. While analyzing the current Artemis architecture, we describe a gradual refactoring of an existing application to decompose Artemis into multiple subsystems. We developed Architect, a framework which is based on a domain-specific language for building dependable distributed systems as a template to ensure the data consistency of the distributed transactions using the Saga pattern. We decomposed Artemis into 3 microservices and provided the migration concept from shared-database to database-per-microservice using Architect. The framework helped to reduce the complexity of using the Saga pattern. It introduced the eventual consistency in a distributed database system and decreased the coupling of the data storage. The migration to a microservice architecture solves many problems of a monolith application, but introduces new challenges and increases the complexity of the overall system. Architect focuses on greenfield project, but currently does not provide a software evolution approach. We will add support for reengineering projects, which can facilitate the migration process of existing system.","","978-1-6654-8980-5","10.1109/iCCECE55162.2022.9875096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9875096","architect;microservices;migration;monolith;sagas","Learning management systems;Green products;Microservice architectures;Distributed databases;Memory;Computer architecture;Software quality","","3","","20","IEEE","7 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, there is an increasing interest in adopting microservices in the field of industrial automation. This raises the question, if and to what degree this architectural style can also be applied for the development of industrial control systems (ICS). In this paper, we have systematically analyzed the applicability of microservices for ICS development. Together with domain experts from industry, we have developed a migration path from a monolithic ICS towards cloud-ready systems based on microservices. By studying the central principles for microservice development and operation, we found that microservices can be applied in the context of ICS and the use of microservices leads to increased flexibility with regard to frequent software releases and the development of new deployment variants. However, communication between real-time services is still an open research challenge that poses a potential technical risk in the migration towards adopting full microservice-based system architectures.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613622","Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613622","Microservices;Industrial Control System;Industrial Automation","Integrated circuits;Industries;Industrial control;Fault tolerant systems;Time to market;Systems architecture;Software","","2","","22","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, Cisco has recently forecast that in the next few years IP traffic related to video services will correspond up to the 80% of the total IP traffic and that mobile data traffic will reach about 367 EB per month by 2020. Aiming at reducing Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) required to satisfy demand growth, service providers are exploring new approaches in contrast to traditional ones. From the transport network perspective, aiming at supporting such traffic growth, telecom network operators need to satisfy services requirements without incurring in network performance degradation and in a cost-effective manner. Therefore, cloud-ready transport networks are on the scope of different network providers, including intelligent control architectures and elastic data planes; i.e. based on novel optical technologies. Considering the telecom cloud, where telecom network resources can be offered as a service, in this paper we present three use cases related to DC interconnection, video distribution and 5G networks, and identify their basic connectivity needs from the transport networks according to realistic scenarios.","","978-1-5090-0296-2","10.1109/NOC.2016.7506987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506987","Cloud Services;Telecom Cloud;5G Networks;Video Distribution","Cloud computing;Streaming media;5G mobile communication;Mobile computing;IP networks","","2","","22","IEEE","9 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This involves building an application using many loosely coupled service-specific components (microservices) that communicate via lightweight APIs, and utilizing containerization technologies to deploy, update, and scale these microservices quickly and independently. However, managing the end-to-end tail latency of requests flowing through the microservices is challenging in the absence of accurate performance models that can capture the complex interplay of microservice workflows with cloudinduced performance variability and inter-service performance dependencies. In this paper, we present performance characterization and modeling of containerized microservices in the cloud. Our modeling approach aims at enabling cloud platforms to combine resource usage metrics collected from multiple layers of the cloud environment, and apply machine learning techniques to predict the end-to-end tail latency of microservice workflows. We implemented and evaluated our modeling approach on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed using KVM for virtualization, Docker Engine for containerization and Kubernetes for container orchestration. Experimental results with an open-source microservices benchmark, Sock Shop, show that our modeling approach achieves high prediction accuracy even in the presence of multi-tenant performance interference.","","978-1-7281-0218-4","10.1109/IC2E.2019.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790059","microservices;containers;cloud computing;performance modeling","Cloud computing;Containers;Interference;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Servers;Computational modeling","","26","","46","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the fifth generation (5G) to follow suit, substantial hands-on experimentation with functional, architectural and deployment aspects is required, and further test trials need to take place in order to inform and enable future verification and certification procedures for 5G to become a proven PPDR technology. This paper studies 5G PPDR experimentation associated with novel virtualized and cloud-native 5G technologies, architectures and deployment options, as well as feasibility studies and field performance and verifications trials involving vertical-specific 5G infrastructures and applications. Key enabling technologies, such as massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO), device-to-device (D2D), network slicing and multi-access edge computing (MEC) are discussed and 5G PPDR architecture and deployment options are investigated. A dedicated 5G PPDR experimentation facility is presented, and a case study of hands-on experimentation is provided. Two distinct scenarios are discussed, i.e., emergency augmentation of the terrestrial 5G PPDR network with rapidly deployable on-site capacities in the area of a public safety incident, and availability and reliability of decision-support PPDR applications on the field. Experience with the deployment and verification insights are accompanied by the results of quality of service (QoS) and non-functional key performance indicators (KPI) assessment that were exhibited during the experiment. The experimentation outcomes confirm the ability of the facility to support emulated laboratory experimentation specifically designed to tackle 5G challenges for this particular vertical as well as field studies recreating realistic public safety operations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064405","Republic of Slovenia and the European Union from the European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:C3330-18-952019 (5G Safety)); European Horizon 2020 Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(grant numbers:957400 (5G-LOGINNOV),957403 (Int5Gent),101016448 (5GASP)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9371761","5G;mobile communications;public safety;public protection and disaster relief;mission critical communications;network architecture;network deployment;experimentation;field trial","5G mobile communication;Streaming media;Safety;Robot sensing systems;Stakeholders;Reliability;Long Term Evolution","","22","","186","CCBY","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network Slicing has been developed to offer service isolation between the different network offerings. Cloud-native services that are composed of a set of inter-dependent micro-services are assigned into their respective slices that usually span multiple service areas, network domains, and multiple data centers. Due to mobility events caused by moving end-users, slices with their assigned resources and services need to be re-scoped and re-provisioned. This leads to slice mobility whereby a slice moves between service areas and whereby the inter-dependent service and resources must be migrated to reduce system overhead and to ensure low-communication latency by following end-user mobility patterns. Recent advances in computational hardware, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have attracted interest within the communication community to study and experiment self-managed network slices. However, migrating a service instance of a slice remains an open and challenging process, given the needed co-ordination between inter-cloud resources, the dynamics, and constraints of inter-data center networks. For this purpose, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning based agent that is using two different algorithms to optimize bandwidth allocations as well as to adjust the network usage to minimize slice migration overhead. We show that this approach results in significantly improved Quality of Experience. To validate our approach, we evaluate the agent under different configurations and in real-world settings and present the results.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3074618","European Union’s Horizon 2020 ICT Cloud Computing program under the ACCORDION project(grant numbers:871793); European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the CHARITY project(grant numbers:101016509); Academy of Finland Project 6Genesis(grant numbers:318927); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409935","5G and beyond;service function chain;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multi-access edge computing;deep reinforcement learning;and management and orchestration","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Channel allocation;Servers;Resource management","","19","","55","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This novel architecture brings agility and accelerates the software development process significantly. However, it is not easy to manage and operate microservice systems due to their scale and complexity. Many approaches are proposed to automatically operate microservice systems such as anomaly detection. Nevertheless, those methods cannot be sufficiently validated and compared due to a lack of real microservice systems, which leads to the slow process of intelligent operation. These challenges inspire us to build a system named “VWR”, a framework of Virtual War Room for operating microservice applications which allows users to simulate their microservice architectures with low overhead and inject multiple types of faults into the microservice system with chaos engineering. VWR can mimic user requests and record the end-to-end tracing data (i.e., service call chains) for each request in a way consistent with OpenTracing. With easily designed tests and the produced streaming tracing data, the users can validate the performance of their intelligent operation algorithms and improve the algorithms as needed. Besides, based on the streaming tracing data generated by VWR, we introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm based on Matrix Sketch and set it as a default intelligent operation algorithm in VWR. This algorithm can detect anomalies by analyzing high-dimensional performance data collected from a microservice system in a streaming manner. The experimental result in VWR shows that the matrix sketch based method can precisely detect anomalies in microservice systems and outperform some widely used anomaly detection methods such as isolation forest in some scenario. We believe more approaches on the intelligent operation of microservice systems can be constructed based on VWR.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977464","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019YFB1804002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802448,6190244,U1811462); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515012229); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9019667","Microservice;virtual war room;matrix sketch;anomaly detection;chaos engineering","Anomaly detection;Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Complexity theory;Tools;Cloud computing","","19","","47","CCBY","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as modern systems have grown in complexity and heterogeneity over the past few decades, advances in development frameworks have dominated. Rather than involving low-level language constructs, these frameworks typically focus on software components, including data entities, controllers, and endpoints. As a result, current code analysis approaches have become unsuitable for analyzing these modern systems due to their focus on low-level constructs in a single language. Thus, code analysis has become a far more complicated endeavor thanks to the plethora of languages, frameworks, and design approaches in modern software development. This paper presents a novel approach to solving the problem of being tied to a single language and its low-level constructs. The system’s source code is transformed into an intermediate representation called a language-agnostic abstract-syntax tree. This system representation is then assessed by generalized component parsers that extract relevant high-level information, such as components, from low-level structures. The design of the approach is presented here in detail, along with its evaluation in a case study involving two large, heterogeneous, cloud-native system benchmarks (Java and C++ microservices). The study demonstrates a unified identification approach to determine system data entities and endpoints. Utilizing higher-level constructs, such as components, can advance the current practice of system analysis to better face broader problems introduced by modern system development practices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3160485","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1854049); Red Hat Research (https://research.redhat.com); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737496","Code analysis;distributed systems;enterprise architecture;microservices","Codes;Microservice architectures;Unified modeling language;Task analysis;Static analysis;Complexity theory;Optimization","","14","","45","CCBY","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we calculate the number of instances based on microservice availability and construct a model in which the total resource demand of multiple microservice instances exceeds the appropriate proportion of node resources when dynamic resource competition exists and the size of the shared dependency library is less than the node storage capacity.

However, the high degree of functional decomposition in SBA has implications in terms of increased inter-NF signaling traffic during the execution of control plane procedures, as well as an increased complexity in orchestrating a system with tight inter-NF dependencies. In this work, we introduce PP5GS as a stateless 5G Core architecture that implements a procedure-based functional decomposition of the 5G Core NFs. We develop Per-Procedure NFs for four different control plane procedures and perform extensive evaluations in a private cloud environment orchestrated with Kubernetes. The results show that PP5GS requires up to 34% and 55% less computing resources compared to the baseline stateful and stateless systems, respectively, while generating at least 40% less signaling traffic.

Although we can casually change configurations, it is not easy to apply optimal configurations, as optimal configurations require deep knowledge of the underlying system. This is problematic because applications with suboptimal configuration result in poor performance. As container and container management systems have emerged as an application platform on the cloud, configuration tuning becomes even more challenging because containers add more complexity to the application performance. We need to consider not only fundamental misconfiguration but also container image verification, deployment configuration, application characteristics awareness based on metrics and logs. Although previous knowledge regarding how we should tune configurations for a system software is sometimes available, knowledge about performance tuning practices is neither normalized nor reusable to expand on any advice for misconfiguration to the containers. Even in the cloud-native environment, there is no centralized service to deliver knowledge continuously to application containers nor a framework to develop a misconfiguration fix rule for a container throughout its lifetime. In this paper, we propose a performance-centric configuration tuning framework for containers on Kubernetes, named ConfAdvisor, that enables containers to achieve a higher performance by validating various misconfigurations adaptively. ConfAdivsor gives config tuning advice to application containers, images, and Kubernetes specs and also provides a development framework to build configuration validation rules. We present the design of ConfAdvisor and provide several case studies to tune application containers in the real world.","","978-1-7281-0218-4","10.1109/IC2E.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790136","cloud computing, containers, microservices, kubernetes, configuration tuning, performance tuning","Containers;Measurement;Tuning;System software;Tools;Monitoring","","11","","40","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding the characteristics of complex workloads is crucial for job scheduling, capacity planning, and performance optimization, which provide guarantees for the normal operation of cloud-native applications. Co-location of online services and batch jobs is a common way to improve resource utilization in today's cloud data centers. It is very important for the resource scheduler to adapt to the characteristics of complex and varied workloads. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis on the latest released trace dataset by Alibaba in December 2018, consists of 4195049 batch jobs and 71476 containers co-locating on about 4000 machines. Different from Alibaba trace 2017, the information of directed acyclic graph (DAG) is added in the trace, which explains the relationship between the jobs and tasks. We first show the basic statics of the cluster. Then, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the workload types and DAG information. The results reveal several new insights: i) The resource utilization in the cluster shows an obvious periodic phenomenon (day and week). ii) There is a resource (e.g. CPU, memory usage) overprovisioning phenomenon in the cluster. iii) The workloads' characteristics of different workload types are very different. iv) The distribution of instance startup time and termination time is unbalanced. v) 90% of the job's DAG length does not exceed 30 while the maximum length is 54.","","978-1-7281-6512-7","10.1109/HPBDIS49115.2020.9130578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9130578","cloud computing;workload characterization;dependency graph analysis;workload type","Cloud computing;Directed acyclic graph;Data centers;Runtime;Processor scheduling;Scalability;Delays","","10","","24","IEEE","1 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Kubernetes is known for its advantage in easy deployment and operations for applications; however, it suffers from low resource utilization, incurring high server provisioning and operational costs, due to following reasons. First, it is common practice for latency-sensitive services to be over-provisioned for the peak load: Kubernetes might consider such peak-load provisioning as constant, even though the actual resource utilization is low. Second, the isolation between different containers is poor and cannot prevent performance degradation when best-effort jobs and latency-sensitive services run together. Users may have to run these two classes of workloads on separate machines to avoid interference, resulting in higher provisioning costs. This paper presents a highly scalable cluster scheduling system named Zeus, which is designed based on Kubernetes extension mechanisms. Zeus achieves safe colocation of best-effort jobs and latency-sensitive services. Furthermore, Zeus schedules best-effort jobs based on the real server utilization and can adaptively allocate resources between the two classes of workloads. In addition, Zeus enhances container isolation by coordinating software and hardware isolation features. As a result, Zeus can effectively improve the resource utilization of Kubernetes clusters. We discuss the design and implementation of Zeus and evaluate its effectiveness using latency-sensitive services and best-effort jobs in a massive production environment. The results show that by colocating latency-sensitive services with best-effort jobs, Zeus can increase the average CPU utilization from 15% to 60% without SLO violations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496625","Big data;Kubernetes;performance isolation;resource efficiency;workload colocation","Containers;Resource management;Servers;Production;Schedules;Heuristic algorithms;Hardware","","10","","29","CCBYNCND","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NFV builds on cloud native technologies, automation, and reusability. Central to the success of NFV is the ability to design service templates once and to on-demand deploy those template services into specific service contexts, e.g., network slices. Therefore, on-demand homing and assigning of service designs with service level requirements over distributed cloud resources and capabilities is one of the main challenges for the transition to NFV. Towards this end, it is important to embed service graphs over the given infrastructure such that the total cost is minimized while satisfying service requirements. To get around the lack of scalability of optimization-based approaches, a viable approach is to rely on efficient Virtual Network Function (VNF) embedding heuristics. Despite their low complexity, VNF embedding heuristics suffer from the so-called causality issue, which means that embedding decisions must be made before all neighboring dependencies were embedded. This, as a result, may lead to an inferior embedding outcome. In this paper, we propose our novel h-horizon sequential greedy look-ahead embedding algorithm, which allows embedding and re-embedding of VNFs based on embedding decisions of other VNFs to overcome the causality issue. Our simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing greedy benchmark in terms of total embedding cost.","","978-1-6654-3983-1","10.1109/NFV-SDN53031.2021.9665063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665063","","Greedy algorithms;Cloud computing;Costs;Simulation;Scalability;Conferences;Software algorithms","","10","","10","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past years, we observe an increased adoption of this technology on numerous IoT- Edge applications. And while this technology comes with its promises and benefits, considering almost infinite scalability, it also comes along with its drawbacks and challenges. Detecting partial failures or bottlenecks are new obstacles that arose with the adoption of Cloud Applications. Distributed Tracing now allows developers to gain insight on the composition of services within a distributed Application. Today we observe an increased adoption of this technology on numerous cloud-native architectures. The project OpenTelemetry proposes a specification for traces that normalizes this new monitoring data format. In this publication we present an approach that leverages these traces to identify bottlenecks at the scale of a physically distributed application. We propose an extension of our model that builds a hierarchical property graph to exhibit bottlenecks in an application that follows the layered Cloud - IoT network model. Based on OpenTelemetry traces we can maintain a model at runtime of the whole application and compute bottlenecks. Their identification relies on the scores provided by centrality algorithms.","1976-7684","978-1-6654-1332-9","10.1109/ICOIN53446.2022.9687217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687217","Distributed Tracing;Multi-zones Cloud;Edge-IoT;Property Graph;Graph Rewriting;Hierarchical Model","Industries;Cloud computing;Runtime;Computational modeling;Scalability;Image edge detection;Computer architecture","","7","","20","IEEE","26 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent two years, 5G pilot services have been launched to deal with the drastic increase in mobile devices and application types. However, since 5G adopts a higher frequency than conventional 3G/4G, base stations must be densified. Therefore, virtualization resources for softwarization in various technologies (e.g., Virtualized RAN (Radio Access Network), Virtualized Core, Virtualized Applications) are more appreciated. In this research, we focus on edge computing, which is one of the cores of Beyond 5G, to utilize the virtualization resources. Critical potentials of edge computing are traffic reduction, low latency, and high security for mobile networks. However, various studies were made based only on numerical analysis or parts of the trial of the experiment due to a lack of technical preparation for end-to-end (E2E) environments (e.g., devices, RAN, Core, applications, human resources) with software/hardware flexibility. To show the state-of-the-art edge computing for Beyond 5G (B5G), we established a true E2E B5G Edge Cloud in Ookayama Campus of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. In addition, focusing on the effective use of computation resources in Edge Clouds as an advantage of edge computing, we proposed a cloud-native with network function deployment architecture for computation resource sharing in different Edge Clouds. Specifically, we focused on Virtualized CU (Central Unit) in RAN and proposed to operate CU-CP (Control Plane) and CU-UP (User Plane) in different Edge Cloud. Its feasibility is validated through a measurement.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-8243-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860668","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860668","Edge Cloud;Virtualization;Proof-of-Concept;Micro-Service;Beyond 5G","Cloud computing;Vehicular and wireless technologies;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Throughput;Resource management;Virtualization","","7","","20","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To satisfy the above requirements, the 5G architecture is designed with the properties of using service-based architecture, cloud-native oriented, adopting IT-based API interfaces and introduction of the Network Repository Function. However, with the wide commercialization of 5G network and the exploration towards 6G, the 5G architecture exposes the disadvantages of high architecture complexity, difficult inter-interface communication, low cognitive capability, bad instantaneity, and deficient intelligence. To overcome these limitations, this paper investigates 6G network architecture, and proposes a cognitive intelligence based distributed 6G network architecture. This architecture consists of a physical network layer and an intelligent decision layer. The two layers coordinate through flexible service interfaces, supporting function decoupling and joint evolution of intelligence services and network services.

These principles are catalyzed by Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions that allow re-usability of common or dedicated Virtual Network Functions, in order to fulfill the diverse vertical requirements for network slices. PaaS solutions can also be extended to Multi-access Edge Computing environments (i.e. at the edge of the cellular network) to take advantage of predefined edge-based network functions and services and to decouple their lifecycle management from centralized, delay-introducing operations. Currently, core-to-edge coordination for end-to-end network slicing, from 5G Core Network to the edge, takes place at a very low abstraction level, leading to significant overheads that pose scalability and latency threats, especially crucial for mission-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we describe a methodology for automating the interaction between the NFV MANO and edge platforms that encompass PaaS functions at the edge. The methodology offers benefits for 1) eliminating configuration, integration and management effort for end-to-end network slicing, and 2) the exposure of edge resources to the NFV MANO as usable platform services.

Compared with virtual machines, containers are lightweight and flexible in resource management. An important quality-of-service (QoS) class in container management is burstable container, whose resource limits are higher than the actual requests allowing a container to expand whenever demands ramp up and additional resources become available. However, efficiently managing burstable containers is challenging, especially for CPU resources. On the one hand, burstable containers should maintain sufficient concurrency, in the form of threads, to utilize extendable CPU resources. On the other hand, the degree of concurrency necessary for utilizing peak CPU resources leads to suboptimal performance when a container's CPU allocation is constrained. In this paper, we recommend that the number of threads in burstable containers should always be set to the CPU limit to guarantee extensibility. However, modern operating systems (OSes) fall short of efficiently managing thread oversubscription. First, the OS CPU scheduler is inefficient for scheduling excessive threads and lacks container awareness. Second, the existing blocking synchronization supported by the OS kernel is inefficient in handling the sleep and wakeup of excessive threads. Finally, the non-blocking synchronization may waste CPUs performing busy waiting when more than one thread in the run queue. To this end, we present a user-level adaptive container scheduler and two OS mechanisms, virtual blocking and busy-waiting detection, to avoid inefficiency in managing burstable containers without requiring program code changes. Experimental results show that our approaches can keep burstable containers efficient while allowing the applications in containers to take advantage of additional CPUs. The performance gain under high system load is up to 29.7×.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3174480","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773966","Container;oversubscription;scheduling","Containers;Central Processing Unit;Resource management;Kernel;Parallel processing;Synchronization;Instruction sets","","6","","41","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main obstacle between current technology and future remote, multi-user AR/VR applications is the stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency requirement, which cannot exceed 20 ms to avoid motion sickness. Emerging AR/VR services put even more pressure on current network infrastructures, calling for considerable advancements toward fully cloud-native architectures. Cloud-based VR services, where participants can virtually interact across vast distances, remain a distant dream. Several challenges still arise concerning the deployment and management of VR services. This paper presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the efficient orchestration of VR services in fog-cloud infrastructures.

However, the new opportunities unlock new security challenges. Man-in-the-middle, denial-of-service attacks and tampering are now becoming easier because of the scattered devices and their varying locations. Meanwhile, the dynamic nature of the cloud raises the need for on-time threats prevention.In this work, we propose a way to answer the new challenges by bringing trust into the virtualized edge infrastructure.

Kubernetes, as a production-grade container orchestration platform, has been proven to be successful at managing containerized applications in on-premises datacenters. However, Kubernetes lacks sufficient multi-tenant supports by design, meaning in cloud environments, dedicated clusters are required to serve multiple users, i.e., tenants. This limitation significantly diminishes the benefits of cloud computing, and makes it difficult to build multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) products using Kubernetes. In this paper, we propose Virtual-Cluster, a new multi-tenant framework that extends Kubernetes with adequate multi-tenant supports. Basically, Virtual Cluster provides both control plane and data plane isolations while sharing the underlying compute resources among tenants. The new framework preserves the API compatibility by avoiding modifying the Kubernetes core components. Hence, it can be easily integrated with existing Kubernetes use cases. Our experimental results show that the overheads introduced by VirtualCluster, in terms of latency and throughput, is moderate.","2575-8411","978-1-6654-4513-9","10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546524","Distributed architecture","Cloud computing;Conferences;Software as a service;Computer architecture;Containers;Throughput;IP networks","","5","","38","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the telecommunications infrastructure evolves into a sort of distributed datacenter, multiple tenants such as vertical industries and network service providers share its aggregate pool of resources (e.g., networking, computing, etc.) in a layered “as-a-Service” approach exposed as slice abstractions. The challenge remains in the coordination of various stakeholders’ assets in realizing end-to-end network slices and supporting the multi-site deployment and chaining of the micro-service components needed to implement cloud-native vertical applications (vApps). In this context, particular care must be taken to ensure that the required resources are identified, made available and managed in a way that satisfies the vApp requirements, allows for a fair share of resources and has a reasonable impact on the overall vApp deployment time. With these challenges in mind, this paper presents the Resource Selection Optimizer (RSO)– a software-service in the MATILDA Operations Support System (OSS), whose main goal is to select the most appropriate network and computing resources (according to some criterion) among a list of options provided by the Wide-area Infrastructure Manager (WIM). It consists of three submodules that respectively handle: (i) the aggregation of vApp components based on affinities, (ii) the forecasting of (micro-) datacenter resources utilization, (iii) and the multi-site placement of the (aggregated) vApp micro-service components. The RSO’s performance is mainly evaluated in terms of the execution times of its submodules while varying their respective input parameters, and additionally, three selection policies are also compared.

Cloud-native L4 load balancers are commonly deployed as virtual network functions (VNFs) and are a critical forwarding element in modern cloud infrastructure. We identify load imbalance among service instances as the main cause of additional processing delay caused by transport-layer load balancers. Existing transport-layer load balancers rely on one of two methods: host-level traffic redirection, which may add as much as 12.48% additional traffic to underlying networks, or connection tracking, which consumes a considerable amount of memory in load balancers. Both of these methods result in inefficient usage of network resources. We propose the in-network congestion-aware load Balancer (INCAB) to achieve even load distribution among service instances and optimal network resources usage in addition to meeting the PCC requirement. We show that INCAB is capable of identifying and monitoring each instance’s most-utilized resource and can improve the load distribution among all service instances. INCAB utilizes a Bloom filter and an ultra-compact connection table for in-network flow distribution. Furthermore, it does not rely on end hosts for traffic redirection. Our flow level simulations show that INCAB improves flows’ average completion time by 31.97% compared to stateless solutions.","","978-1-7281-4545-7","10.1109/NFV-SDN47374.2019.9040109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9040109","software defined networks;transport layer load balancing;network function virtualization.","Electronics packaging;Load management;Data centers;Monitoring;Network function virtualization;Cloud computing;Conferences","","4","","18","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dynamic selection of cloud resources to serve off-loaded 5G-NWDAF, while incurring minimum cost and maximizing utilization of served next generation Node-Bs (gNBs) requires agility and automation.

The advent of Softwarized Networks has led to a renewed interest in intent-based network policy management. Intent-based Networking provides a structured way of specifying the intent of policies which are automatically translated and compiled into network device configuration. While this top-down approach of policy intent to policy configuration has worked well for cloud-native infrastructures such as data centers, it has not seen much adoption in legacy networks. We believe one of the primary reasons for this is the semantic gap between policy intents and policy configurations. The problem is further exacerbated by the heterogeneity, scale-on-the-fly, fragmentation, and lack of structure in non-intent native networks. We introduce Policy Intent Inference (PII) System to bridge the semantic gap with its advanced inference layer that extracts the policy intents from policy configurations fragmented over disparate network devices. We adopt a bottom-up approach to extract all policies within network devices, abstract them into a structured data model, and with the use of clustering and information retrieval techniques, build an optimal solution to extract network-wide policy intents from the underlying network that eases policy management especially policy troubleshooting, reducing the configuration clutter and reducing the time taken to compile and resolve conflicts in policies.","2693-9789","978-1-6654-0522-5","10.1109/NetSoft51509.2021.9492552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9492552","Semantic Analysis;Advanced Policy Management;Intent-based Softwarized Networks","Data centers;Conferences;Semantics;Tools;Metadata;Information retrieval;Data mining","","3","","33","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, a novel hierarchical distributed overarching architecture of decoupled federation and orchestration frameworks for multidomain ETSI-compliant NFV MANOs is proposed. The proposed architecture can minimize overhead costs for the scalable exchange of abstracted vertical service information through hierarchical brokering and can enable flexible federation through distributed binding among multiple domains.

In order to deal with those problems, Kubernetes was introduced in 2015 as a container orchestration platform to simplify the management of containers. Kubernetes simplifies managing a large scale number of docker containers, however, the fairness is a missing point in the Kubernetes that has been applied in other platforms such as Apache Hadoop, YARN and Mesos. Assigning resource limits fairly among the pods in kubernetes becomes a challenging issue as some applications may require intensive resources such as CPU and memory that should be maximized to satisfy them.

To maximize this potential, we propose the creation of a trading market to encourage interactions between service supporters (vehicle platoons) and requesters (task vehicles). Current trading decisions based on game and negotiations can lead to unpredicted handover costs and increased communication overhead in dynamic environments. Moreover, existing research tends to overlook a mutually beneficial trading philosophy by focusing on either the service supporters’ profitability or the user experience of resource-restrained requesters. Addressing these issues, we introduce a multi-objective optimization problem to model environmental dynamics and uncertainty, aiming to maximize both platoons’ and task vehicles’ long-term utilities while maintaining a satisfactory service access ratio. To tackle the problem within acceptable time frames, we develop a global-local training architecture, incorporating a hybrid action space and prioritized sampling into a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes a twin delayed deep deterministic gradient (GL-HPMATD3). This approach facilitates consensus in the trading market on key issues, including service request selection, resource allocation, and trading pricing.

To simplify the elasticity management, the trend is to create an auto-scaler instance per microservice, which controls its horizontal scalability by using the classic threshold-based policy. Although easy to implement, setting manually the scaling thresholds, which are usually statically-defined on a single metric, may lead to poor scaling decisions when applications are heterogeneous in terms of resource consumption. In this article, we study dynamic multi-metric threshold-based scaling policies, that exploit Reinforcement Learning (RL) to autonomously update the scaling thresholds, one per controlled resource (CPU and memory). The proposed RL approaches (i.e., QL, MB, and DQL Threshold) use different degrees of knowledge about the system dynamics. To model the thresholds’ adaptation actions, we consider two RL-based architectures. In the single-agent architecture, one agent drives the updates of both scaling thresholds. To speed-up the learning, the multi-agent architecture adopts a distinct agent per threshold. Simulation- and prototype-based results show the benefits of the proposed solutions when compared to the state-of-the-art policies and highlight the advantages of multi-agent MB Threshold and DQL Threshold approaches, in terms of deployment objectives and execution times.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2022.3163357","Google; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9744560","Elasticity;self-adaptation;reinforcement learning;deep Q-learning;microservice architecture.","Microservice architectures;Measurement;Elasticity;Computer architecture;Adaptation models;Time factors;Cloud computing","","3","","48","IEEE","29 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is also expected that applications on UEs are implemented as container clusters similar to cloud-native applications and they are deployed on computing clusters. ContMEC has the following three features: (i) constructing a computing cluster per edge station for scalability to the number of UEs, (ii) hierarchical resource management for scalability and efficient resource sharing among computing clusters, and (iii) overlapped computing clusters for efficient resource sharing. A PoC (Proof-of Concept) implementation of ContMEC employs Kubernetes as a container orchestration system without modifications although Kubernetes does not take account of the MEC infrastructure.

The deployment of complex applications in such environments should be done by taking into account the interactions that may arise from the overlapping of these two different levels of virtualization. In this paper, we first describe a preliminary evaluation of a containerized application that has been obtained by refactoring a monolithic application into microservices. The application was deployed in a private Cloud system that relies on Kubernetes, which is a cluster management software for Docker containers that have been deployed on top of OpenStack-managed KVM virtual machines. Subsequently, in order to systematically investigate the possible interactions that can be produced when multiple containers running different kinds of workloads are activated on top of virtual machines, we present and analyze the results obtained by running different benchmarks in a testbed setup. From the analysis of the benchmark results, we derive some guidelines that should be taken into account by container schedulers when container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, are deployed on top of a virtualized IaaS layer.","2642-6587","978-1-7281-6972-9","10.1109/SOSE49046.2020.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183339","Cloud computing, containers, microservices","Containers;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Software;Virtualization;Computer architecture;Scalability","","3","","21","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the service efficiency is reduced as the scaling is delayed because dynamic loads occur with various workload patterns. Furthermore, estimating the efficient resource size for the workload is difficult, resulting in resource waste and overload. Therefore, this study proposes high-performance resource management (HiPerRM), which stably and elastically manages container resources to ensure service scalability and efficiency even under rapidly changing dynamic loads. HiPerRM forecasts future workloads using a sample convolutional and interaction network (SCINet) model applied with the reversible instance normalization (RevIN) method. HiPerRM generates a resource request with an elastic size based on the forecasted CPU and memory usage, and then efficiently adjusts the pod's resource request and the number of replicas via HiPerRM's VPA (Hi-VPA) and HiPerRM's HPA (Hi-HPA). As a result of evaluating the performance of HiPerRM, the average resource utilization was improved by approximately 3.96–34.06% compared to conventional autoscaling techniques, even when the resource size was incorrectly estimated for various workloads, and there were relatively fewer overloads.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2023.3292378","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(grant numbers:2022-0-00047); Development of Microservices Development/Operation Platform Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173549","Cloud computing;container resource autoscaling;resource management;time-series forecasting","Cloud computing;Containers;Measurement;Resource management;Predictive models;Microservice architectures;Scalability","","3","","34","IEEE","5 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic principle of the platform is that industrial wireless networks need to be tested continuously as the environment might change continuously. Given the complexity and variety of current factory use cases, we argue that network capabilities must be characterized continuously, on a per-UE (User Equipment), and per SLA fashion. In this perspective, the platform described in this paper enables i) the creation and management of SLA definitions through a custom-built SLA compiler, ii) all the automation needed to continuously test the network continuously, according to the defined SLAs. The platform includes a dedicated embedded hardware and a cloud-native back end providing services at the network core level.

In this approach, an IoT infrastructure composed of devices deployed at the network edge can seamlessly be integrated as an application execution infrastructure to enable interactions with hosted sensors/actuators. This paper discusses several perspectives available in the literature on the (IoT) edge-based serverless paradigm and related use cases in an IoT/edge computing context.

Managing this cloud-native network in a cost-effective way requires tightly cou-pled control of connectivity and processing resources. This paper proposes an optimization problem to minimize the overall cost while guaranteeing distinct latency and reliability requirements of different network slices deployed over the infrastructure. This is achieved by choosing for each service, the functional split and transmission parameters that best adapt to the connectivity and processing resources available in the infrastructure. Results demonstrate that the proposed flexible resource allocation scheme provides considerable cost saving (up to 2.4 times) and reduced request blocking (up to 2 times) compared to conventional fixed deployment techniques. The reliability requirements can be guaranteed by packet duplication and/or virtualized forward error correction at the expense of consuming connectivity and/or processing resources, respectively. The flexible assurance of the reliability requirements in the proposed scheme contributes considerably to the achieved improvements on cost saving and request blocking.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685414","Network Function Virtualization;Network Slicing;Functional split;Optical transport networks;Reliability;5G","Costs;Process control;Quality of service;Forward error correction;Optical fiber networks;Reliability engineering;Reliability","","3","","20","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the standardisation process of JSON Schema and the implementation of adequate tool support (e.g., validators and editors) are work in progress. However, the periodic issuing of newer JSON Schema drafts makes tool development challenging. Nevertheless, many JSON Schemas as language definitions exist, but JSON documents are still mostly edited in basic text-based editors. To tackle this challenge, we investigate in this paper how Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methods for language engineering can help in this area. Instead of re-inventing the wheel of building up particular technologies directly for JSON, we study how the existing MDE infrastructures may be utilized for JSON. In particular, we present a bridge between the JSONware and Modelware technical spaces to exchange languages and documents. Based on this bridge, our approach supports language engineers, domain experts, and tool providers in editing, validating, and generating tool support with enhanced capabilities for JSON schemas and their documents. We evaluate our approach with Shipyard, a JSON Schema-based language for the workflow specification for Keptn, an open-source tool for DevOps automation of cloud-native applications. The results of the case study show that proper editors and language evolution support from MDE can be reused and, at the same time, the surface syntax of JSON is maintained.","","978-1-6654-3495-9","10.1109/MODELS50736.2021.00033","Marie Skłodowska-Curie(grant numbers:813884); ECSEL Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:101007350); Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:30525-N31); Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:867535,18006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592494","JSON;JSON Schema;MDE;DevOps;Tool Interoperability","Bridges;Automation;Buildings;Wheels;Tools;Syntactics;Model driven engineering","","3","","38","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This will lead to load imbalance among containers with its default rough load balancing mechanism. To deal with this problem, we firstly propose a Dynamically Weighted Random Routing (DWRR) algorithm based on the default random algorithm in Kubernetes. Besides, we design and implement ProxyDWRR, a load balancing plugin for the Kubernetes cluster with heterogeneous CPU. It is fully compatible with the existing load balancing mechanism in Kubernetes.

We also discuss the key issues that currently remain unsolved and highlight a few research opportunities for better support of FaaS in the Compute Continuum.","2377-5750","979-8-3503-3763-1","10.1109/PDP59025.2023.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136957","Serverless;compute continuum;edge computing","Scalability;Pricing;Distance measurement;Delays;Augmented reality","","2","","41","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By decoupling SFs from the physical equipment where they are executed, it is possible to make network services scalable and flexible. These advantages become even more evident in the forthcoming 6G networks, where the overall environment is expected to become more dynamic and cloud-based, with SFs deployed as cloud-native functions. However, in order to efficiently manage and compose services using these SFs, it is necessary to monitor the available resources of the nodes where they can be deployed, in addition to exchange information relevant to the operational status of active SFs. To this aim, we propose a lightweight monitoring architecture by using agents in charge of monitoring the status of SFs running in co-located clusters. These monitoring agents exchange their information by means of a gossip protocol, which allows increasing the reliability of the process. In this way, it is possible to keep service decisions as local as possible, limiting the interactions with centralized decision and orchestration platforms, and thus increasing network scalability and responsiveness. Performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution, and demonstrates that the network overhead of the distributed monitoring process is definitely affordable.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3263542","University of Perugia, and 5G-CARMEN; European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:825012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089874","6G;network signaling;network discovery;network monitoring;gossip protocol","Protocols;Monitoring;6G mobile communication;Peer-to-peer computing;Proposals;Cloud computing;Computer architecture","","2","","45","CCBY","31 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a design flaw of the external IP in K8s leads to the service-oriented man-in-the-middle attack. Existing solutions (e.g., script monitor) attempt to address it passively, which allows attackers enough analysis time to bypass these static rule reviews. Differently, we propose a mutation-enabled proactive defense mechanism, aiming to change the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. It involves the address mutation (i.e., network identification) module and the connection ID (i.e., communication identification) mutation module. In the former module, we analyze mutation constraints and prove the corresponding mutation grouping problem to be NP-hard. Then, a maximally coloring-driven mutation grouping algorithm is developed. Since the address allocation time grows linearly with the service size, we design a prefetched address allocation algorithm. After designing the interaction flow between modules, we present a randomized algorithm in the latter module. Thus our mechanism does not affect methods oriented to other attacks. Eventually, it can continuously interrupt the attack and keep the service connection by incrementally updating K8s and the transport layer protocol. Experiments in the Alibaba cloud demonstrate that it can effectively defend against the attack with an acceptable performance loss.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2023.3238125","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62225105,62001057); Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:2021RC26); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021881","Cloud security;kubernetes;MITM attack;proactive defense;address mutation;QUIC","IP networks;Containers;Servers;Security;Resource management;Color;Cloud computing","","2","","45","IEEE","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our preliminary experimental results show that X-IO’s zero-copy interfaces achieve 2.8x-4.1x performance improvement compared to kernel-based interfaces.

One of them is known as Service Function Chaining (SFC), where providers benefit from network softwarization to create virtual chains of connected micro-services. Research has tackled SFC Allocation (SFCA) through theoretical modeling and heuristic algorithms, which often cannot cope with the dynamic behavior of the network. Recent works have addressed these challenges through Machine Learning (ML), which can be capable of dynamically reconfiguring cloud-native service requirements over the continuum of virtual resources in next-generation networks.

To this end, service mesh provides a potential solution in efficient microservices management. However, as a traditional cloud-oriented architecture, it can not be applied into edge computing directly since the centralized controller policy.

The problem is formulated into a non-linear optimization form and then linearized into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.

Moreover, it provides built-in security and mechanisms for slicing. Despite all these capabilities, there remain many gaps and opportunities for additional capabilities to support end-to-end secure operations for applications across many domains. Although 5G supports mechanisms for network slicing and tunneling, new algorithms and mechanisms that can adapt network slice configurations dynamically to accommodate urgent and mission-critical traffic are needed.

In a MSA, the application is built as a composite of microservices (also called services) where each service is dedicated to providing specific functionalities and communicating via APIs. The service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer serving as a service-to-service communication platform. It is introduced to alleviate the complexity, manageability, and interoperability challenges involved in a MSA. Even though the service mesh includes APIs to secure service-to-service communication, more functionality is needed to handle the perimeter-less and dynamic cloud environment. The existing APIs enable security measures based on a pre-defined configuration. However, there is no mechanism for dynamic trust evaluation of the participating services, which is necessary to protect the application from potential attacks. Attackers can exploit a vulnerability caused by a rouge service as a backdoor to compromise the application. Thus, there is a need for a trust evaluation mechanism in the service mesh to follow zero-trust architecture (ZTA) principles. This paper introduces a runtime trust evaluator (RTE) incorporated as a component within the service mesh control plane. A RTE can evaluate the trustworthiness of services at runtime before establishing service-to-service communications. The core functionality of a RTE is to assess the new service invocation requests initiated by a service to evaluate the trustworthiness of that service. The RTE collects the services’ invocation history and other telemetric data to determine the services’ criticality level for single-point failure. The RTE assesses service invocation request attributes to determine the existence of an unauthorized request and the impact on the requested service’s criticality level. The result is an evaluation of the initiator service’s trustworthiness. We demonstrate our approach on an open source microservice application from the Google Cloud team called Online Boutique. The environment setup uses Kubernetes as an orchestration solution and Istio as the service mesh platform.","","979-8-3503-1635-3","10.1109/FiCloud58648.2023.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10410687","Service mesh;microservice architecture;runtime trust evaluation;zero trust architecture","Cloud computing;Runtime;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Telemetry;Risk management;History","","1","","34","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergence of edge computing has prompted the research of placement strategies that consider the possibility of instantiating microservices in cloud and edge data centers to improve specific performance metrics, such as the time the application spent serving a user request, also referred to as user delay or makespan. Microservice applications differ in many architectural properties, such as the number of microservices, the number of them involved per request, their dependency graph, and the presence of centralized databases. We found that these properties influence the possibility of a placement strategy to exploit edge resources to reduce user delay; therefore, they constitute an application-level optimization space that, however, has not yet been explored in the literature. Accordingly, this paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap by answering the following question: which are the architectural properties of a microservice application that enable it to be more edge-native, that is, to better reduce user delay by using edge computing? Our results are based on a new analytical modeling of the average user delay provided by a microservice application deployed on cloud/edge resources and a new heuristic placement strategy that take into account key aspects of the application, and the supporting cloud and network environment, not considered by previous literature works.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277759","Italian RESTART Program funded by European Union–NextGenerationEU through Italian PNRR (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129183","Edge computing;microservices;placement problems;delay performance;analytical modeling","Microservice architectures;Delays;Data centers;Edge computing;Analytical models;Servers;Cloud computing","","1","","47","CCBYNCND","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This process of onboarding business services to CSOC's security monitoring and incident management platform is described as Cybersecurity Onboarding. Cybersecurity Onboarding is a specialist technical process of setting up and configuring digital business services to generate appropriate interaction telemetry, such as events, logs, messages, metrics, and observables. These telemetric indicators when correlated and analysed reveal whether the business service may have been compromised or not. In this paper we rethink the approach to onboarding services to CSOC.

Therefore, this paper proposes an open-data, open-source and community-driven data aggregation system that can receive and validate medical contributions from around the world.

Our solution for obtaining this dataset aims to promote transparency and trust among these autonomous diagnosis systems. The aggregation pipeline is designed with guidance from medical specialists and the collected dataset will be validated, anonymized and made publicly available. A self-diagnosis system was designed as a proof-of-concept for the open-data platform. A symptom-disease knowledge database was used as dataset and the system was deployed on a cloud-native environment so it can be validated by doctors and users.

DASEE was recently used to simulate the performance of a distributed Kalman filter (DKF) for autonomous satellite navigation in a 112-node Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft constellation. Preliminary results show that the DKF algorithm converges in a centralized simulation but clearly diverges when executed in a decentralized simulation. Divergence is caused by the covariance matrix some-times losing positive-definiteness.

A central mechanism called scaling or auto-scaling is responsible for adjusting the allocated resources dynamically to current or predicted demands. Most of today's solutions support short-term optimization, where the long-term effect of scaling actions is not considered, therefore the overall operational cost can be sub-optimal. In this paper, we address this issue and provide a long and short-term scaling optimization method called LSSO. Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce the formal description of the LSSO scaling problem motivated by real cloud native applications. Second, we transform the problem into a tractable graph representation and show that the optimal solution of the original problem emerges as a shortest path problem in the graph. As a result, the transformation and the optimal solution can be computed in polynomial time. Third, we evaluate and validate the proposed algorithm by numerical analysis on multiple datasets using a cost model which considers the running and scaling costs. Results suggest that if the dynamics of the traffic is fairly predictable and the scaling cost is not negligible, LSSO is able to reduce the operation costs significantly. The exact cost gain depends on the ratio of the running and scaling costs, but in realistic operation regimes it can reach even 18 % and the method can also tolerate some inaccuracies in the forecast.","","978-1-6654-7334-7","10.1109/NFV-SDN56302.2022.9974612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9974612","cloud computing;scaling optimization","Shortest path problem;Costs;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Optimization methods;Transforms;Predictive models","","1","","23","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent research papers indicate that security testing of microservices is often neglected for reasons such as lack of time, lack of experience in the security domain, and absence of automated test environments. Even though several security scanning tools exist to detect container, containerized workload management (Kubernetes), and network issues, none individually is sufficient to cover all security problems in microservices. Using multiple scanning tools increases the complexity of analyzing findings and mitigating security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a fully automated test tool suite that can help developers address security issues in microservices and resolve them. It targets to reduce time and effort in security activities by encapsulating open-source scanning tools into one suite and providing improved feedback. The developed security scanning suite is named Pomegranate. To develop Pomegranate, we employed Design Science and conducted our investigation in Ericsson. We have evaluated our tool using a static approach. The evaluation results indicate that the Pomegranate could be helpful to developers by providing simplified and classified outputs for security vulnerabilities in microservices. More than half of the practitioners who give us feedback found Pomegranate helpful in detecting and mitigating security problems in microservices. We conclude that a fully automated test tool suite can help developers to address most security issues in microservices. Based on the findings in this paper, the direction for future work is to conduct a dynamic validation of Pomegranate in a live project.","","979-8-3503-1196-9","10.1109/ICSSP59042.2023.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10169061","Microservices;Security;Kubernetes;Security Scanning Tools","Microservice architectures;Organizations;Containers;Software;Complexity theory;Security;Testing","","1","","16","IEEE","6 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the size and complexity of these models hampers their deployment at the edge, where heterogeneity of resource types and constraints on resources is the norm. Second, ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To address the edge deployment issue, model compression techniques, especially model quantization, have shown significant promise. However, the adversarial robustness of such quantized models remains mostly an open problem. To address this challenge, this paper investigates whether quantized models with different precision levels can be vulnerable to the same universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). Based on these insights, the paper then presents a cloud-native service that generates and distributes adversarially robust compressed models deployable at the edge using a novel, defensive post-training quantization approach. Experimental evaluations reveal that although quantized models are vulnerable to UAPs, post-training quantization on the synthesized, adversarially-trained models are effective against such UAPs. Furthermore, deployments on heterogeneous edge devices with flexible quantization settings are efficient thereby paving the way in realizing adversarially robust data-driven cloud/edge services.","","978-1-6654-9115-0","10.1109/IC2E55432.2022.00032","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1952029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9946245","Adversarial machine learning;universal perturbation;edge computing;quantization;hardware acceleration","Quantization (signal);Perturbation methods;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Robustness;Complexity theory","","1","","59","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when encountering continuous workflow requests and unexpected resource request spikes, the engine is limited to the current workflow load information for resource allocation, which lacks the agility and predictability of resource allocation, resulting in over and under-provisioning resources. This mechanism seriously hinders workflow execution efficiency and leads to high resource waste. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive resource allocation scheme named adaptive resource allocation scheme (ARAS) for the Kubernetes-based workflow engines. Considering potential future workflow task requests within the current task pod's lifecycle, the ARAS uses a resource scaling strategy to allocate resources in response to high-concurrency workflow scenarios. The ARAS offers resource discovery, resource evaluation, and allocation functionalities and serves as a key component for our tailored workflow engine (KubeAdaptor). By integrating the ARAS into KubeAdaptor for workflow containerized execution, we demonstrate the practical abilities of KubeAdaptor and the advantages of our ARAS. Compared with the baseline algorithm, experimental evaluation under three distinct workflow arrival patterns shows that ARAS gains time-saving of 9.8% to 40.92% in the average total duration of all workflows, time-saving of 26.4% to 79.86% in the average duration of individual workflow, and an increase of 1% to 16% in centrol processing unit (CPU) and memory resource usage rate.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2023.000073","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873030,62002019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184981","resource allocation;workflow containerization;Kubernetes;workflow management engine","Deep learning;Reinforcement learning;Distance measurement;Central Processing Unit;Resource management;Task analysis;Engines","","1","","40","","17 Jul 2023","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

We deal with this issue by introducing the CloudCL framework, which enables developers to focus their implementation efforts on compute kernels without having to consider inter-node communication. Using CloudCL, developers can access the resources of an entire cluster as if they were local resources. The framework also facilitates the development of cloud-native application behavior by supporting dynamic addition and removal of resources at runtime. The combination of a straightforward job design and the corresponding job scheduling framework make sure that cluster resources are used efficiently and fairly.

However, software solutions are typically orders of magnitude less efficient than dedicated hardware in terms of power consumption and processing speed. Consequently, realizing highly-efficient, massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) solutions in software, while exploiting the wide 5G transmission bandwidths, becomes extremely challenging and requires the massive parallelization of the PHY processing tasks. In this work, for the first time, we show that massively parallel software solutions are capable of meeting the processing requirements of 5G New Radio (NR), still, with a significant increase in the corresponding power consumption. In this context, we quantify this power consumption overhead, both in terms of Watts and carbon emissions, as a function of the concurrently transmitted information streams, of the base-station antennas, and of the utilized bandwidth. We show that the computational power consumption of such PHY processing is no longer negligible and that, for mMIMO solutions supporting a large number of information streams, it can become comparable to the power consumption of the Radio Frequency (RF) chains. Finally, we discuss how a shift towards non-linear PHY processing can significantly boost energy efficiency, and we further highlight the importance of energy-aware digital signal processing design in future PHY processing architectures.","","978-1-6654-5975-4","10.1109/GCWkshps56602.2022.10008564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10008564","power efficiency;software-based 5G NR;Open RAN;massive MIMO","Radio frequency;Power demand;Software architecture;Transmitting antennas;Bandwidth;New Radio;Physical layer","","1","","26","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents NFScaler, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered 5G network function scaler that can perform a zero-shot sim2real transfer. The proposed NFScaler automatically adjusts the number of 5G network function instances running in a network slice based on changes in user traffic to meet the QoS requirement of the slice while reducing the resource consumption (i.e. CPU and power). The NFScaler consists of two main parts: a domain randomiser and a deepreinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The domain randomiser randomises the dynamic parameters of a simulation to provide the DRL agent with a range of simulation environments. The DRL agent interacts with both the original simulation and the randomised simulation to learn a generalisable autoscaling policy. The performance of the proposed NFScaler is evaluated in a live 5G network and compared with the threshold-based KEDA scaler, which is the industry standard event-based autoscaler used in cloud native environments, as well as a DRL method that does not involve sim2real transfer. The experimental findings demonstrate that NFScaler effectively guarantees the QoS requirements of the network slice, outperforming the benchmark methods. In particular, NFScaler achieves an improvement of almost 40% in QoS (throughput) performance compared to KEDA Scaler. Furthermore, the proposed NFScaler allocates a significantly lower number of CPU cores to the user plane of the network slice, with an average of 75% fewer cores than when the user plane is hosted on a dedicated bare metal server. In addition, the NFScaler reduces the power consumption of the user plane of the network slice by an average of 45% compared to hosting the user plane on a dedicated bare metal server.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-6958-8","10.1109/NetSoft60951.2024.10588892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10588892","Network slicing;QoS assurance;energy efficiency;5G UPF autoscaling;sim2real transfer;deep reinforcement learning","Power demand;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Metals;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning;Throughput","","","","25","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Little work, however, has yet been devoted to developing a standard framework for wireless testbed automation which is hardwareagnostic and compatible with edge- and cloud-native technologies. Such a solution would simplify the development of new testbeds by completely or partially removing the requirement for custom management and orchestration software. In this paper, we present the first such mostly hardwareagnostic wireless testbed automation framework, Ainur. It is designed to configure, manage, orchestrate, and deploy workloads from an end-to-end perspective. Ainur is built on top of cloudnative technologies such as Docker, and is provided as FOSS to the community through the KTH-EXPECA/Ainur repository on GitHub. We demonstrate the utility of the platform with a series of scenarios, showcasing in particular its flexibility with respect to physical link definition, computation placement, and automation of arbitrarily complex experimental scenarios.","","978-3-8007-6001-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071946","","","","","","","","15 Mar 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Recent increases in data collection coupled with machine learning have the potential to expand landscape monitoring capabilities. We present a computer vision solution to the problem of identifying invasive species. The Australian Tree Fern (Cyathea cooperi) is a fast growing species that is displacing slower growing native plants across the Hawaiian islands. The Nature Conservancy organization has partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop and test an automated tree fern detection and mapping solution based on imagery collected from fixed wing aircraft. We utilize deep learning to identify tree ferns and map their locations. Distinguishing between invasive and native tree ferns in aerial images is challenging for human experts. We explore techniques such as image embeddings and principal component analysis to assist in the classification. Creating quality training datasets is critical for developing ML solutions. We describe how semi-automated labeling tools can expedite this process. These steps are integrated into an automated cloud native inference pipeline that reduces localization time from weeks to minutes. We further investigate issues encountered when the pipeline is utilized on novel images and a decline in performance relative to the training data is observed. We trace the origin of the problem to a subset of images originating from steep mountain slopes and riverbanks which generate blurring and streaking patterns mistakenly labeled as tree ferns. We propose a preprocessing step based on Haralick texture features which detects and flags images different from the training set. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well and can potentially enhance the model performance by relabeling and retraining the model iteratively.","2690-621X","979-8-3503-2056-5","10.1109/WACVW58289.2023.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10031215","","Training;Computer vision;Web services;Pipelines;Training data;Vegetation;Organizations","","","","21","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Leveraging the massive computing power of the cloud and low-latency connectivity to the edge can compensate for this lack of computing resources. However, this introduces a new challenge related to the deployment of complex robotic software across multiple devices, especially in a large-scale system. This paper presents KubeROS, a unified and fully managed platform for automated deployment of robotic applications developed on top of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), in a hybrid computing infrastructure with robots, edge and cloud. KubeROS uses Kubernetes from Cloud Native Computing as its underlying software orchestration framework. It aims to help researchers and developers with no prior cloud computing knowledge deploy their ROS2-based robotic applications at any scale. KubeROS eliminates the need for system configuration and network setup. We demonstrate the applicability of KubeROS by deploying a fleet of simulated mobile manipulators in a clas-sical pick-and-place application. The experiments demonstrate the effects of different deployment strategies for vision-based motion planning under different fleet sizes and workloads. In addition, KubeROS improves task performance by using high-performance computing at the edge and in the cloud, and achieves high resource efficiency when using the shared deployment strategy.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160632","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:13FH579KX9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160632","","Cloud computing;Operating systems;Memory management;Manipulators;Software;Planning;Large-scale systems","","","","46","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It inaugurates the era of extreme ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC), and pervades the digitalization of the various vertical immersive use cases. Since 6G inherently underpins artificial intelligence (AI), we propose a systematic and standalone slice termed SliceOps that is natively embedded in the 6G architecture, which gathers and manages the whole AI lifecycle through monitoring, re-training, and deploying the machine learning (ML) models as a service for the 6G slices. By leveraging machine learning operations (MLOps) in conjunction with eXplainable AI (XAI), SliceOps strives to cope with the opaqueness of black-box AI using explanation-guided reinforcement learning (XRL) to fulfill transparency, trustworthiness, and interpretability in the network slicing ecosystem. This article starts by elaborating on the architectural and algorithmic aspects of SliceOps. Then, the deployed cloud-native SliceOps working is exemplified via a latency- aware resource allocation problem. The deep RL (DRL)-based SliceOps agents within slices provide AI services aiming to allocate optimal radio resources and impede service quality degradation.

A contentious architectural decision in microservices is to compose them using choreography or orchestration. In choreography, every service works independently, whereas, in orchestration, there is a controller that coordinates service interactions. This paper makes a case for orchestration. The promise of microservices is that each microservice can be independently developed, deployed, tested, upgraded, and scaled. This makes them suitable for systems running on cloud infrastructures. However, microservice-based systems become complicated due to the complex interactions of various services, concurrent events, failing components, developers’ lack of global view, and configurations of the environment. This makes maintaining and debugging such systems very challenging. We hypothesize that orchestrated services are easier to debug and to test this we ported the largest publicly available microservices’ benchmark TrainTicket [24], which is implemented using choreography, to a fault-oblivious stateful workflow framework Temporal [19]. We report our experience in porting the code from traditional choreographed microservice architecture to one orchestrated by Temporal and present our initial findings of time to debug the 22 bugs present in the benchmark. Our findings suggest that an effort towards making a transition to orchestrated approach is worthwhile, making the ported code easier to debug.","","978-1-6654-9596-7","10.1145/3510455.3512777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793520","Microservices;Distributed Systems;Orchestration;Workflow Engines;Fault tolerance;Debugging","Visualization;Codes;Software architecture;Computer bugs;Microservice architectures;Debugging;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Engines","","","","25","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coupled with the expectation of supporting billions of connected devices, these requirements can be achieved by exploiting New Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) architectures. One such emerging architecture is Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), whose Next Generation NodeB (gNB) functions are physically decoupled into distinct entities, such as Radio Unit (RU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Central Unit (CU). The CUs are connected to 5G Core Network (CN) and are likely to be virtualized and distributed across multiple (micro and macro) data centers. The virtualized CUs (vCUs) are further decoupled into virtualized CU Control-Plane (vCU-CP) and virtualized CU User-Plane (vCU-UP) to increase flexibility and scalability. As these 5G RAN entities are virtualized, various resiliency schemes, such as container migration, must be considered to overcome possible congestion in or malfunction of the hosting server.In this paper, two distinct cloud-native RAN resiliency scenarios are evaluated while live-migrating gNB-vCU-CP with the objective of maintaining User Equipment (UE) connection time short and user data service uninterrupted in support of smart living and other advanced applications.","2693-9789","979-8-3503-9980-6","10.1109/NetSoft57336.2023.10175418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10175418","Disaggregated 5G;virtual RAN;docker container;5G Resiliency;NFV","Data centers;Cloud computing;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Cloud radio access networks;Containers;Copper","","","","26","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the debugging/testing/maintenance scenarios, we might be able to achieve greater levels of test coverage (and eventually improved reliability) by modelling and verifying at least their most fundamental building blocks and their interconnections. The main objective of our work is to integrate stochastic modelling and verification techniques based on deep learning methods into the debugging cycle in order to handle large state spaces more efficiently, i.e. by steering the process of traversing state space towards suspicious situations that may result in potential bugs in the actual system with smart steering during the traversal. For this purpose, our presented and illustrated approach combines (among others) Continuous Time Markov Chain modelling (CTMC) techniques with deep learning methods including autoencoder, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Our experiences are summarized with widespread cloud design patterns including load balancing and service mesh topologies. According to the results, the debugging cycle can be partly automated through the application of deep learning methods.

It leverages serverless computing to minimize operational management and enhance resource efficiency, and utilizes the concept of edge computing to allow code execution near the data sources. However, edge devices powered by renewable energy face challenges due to energy input variability, resulting in imbalances in their operational availability. As a result, high-powered nodes may waste excess energy, while lowpowered nodes may frequently experience unavailability, impacting system sustainability. Addressing this issue requires energy-aware resource schedulers, but existing cloud-native serverless frameworks are energy-agnostic. To overcome this, we propose an energyaware scheduler for sustainable serverless edge systems. We introduce a reference architecture for such systems and formally model energy-aware resource scheduling, treating the function-to-node assignment as an imbalanced energy-minimizing assignment problem. We then design an optimal offline algorithm and propose faasHouse, an online energy-aware scheduling algorithm that utilizes resource sharing through computation offloading. Lastly, we evaluate faasHouse against benchmark algorithms using real-world renewable energy traces and a practical cluster of single-board computers managed by Kubernetes. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in balanced operational availability (by 46%) and throughput (by 44%) compared to the Kubernetes scheduler.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2024.3354296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10400820","edge computing;serverless;function-as-a-service;energy awareness;scheduling;sustainability","Edge computing;Internet of Things;Renewable energy sources;Logic gates;Containers;Batteries;Computers","","","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Further, the wide adoption of cloud-native technology, like containers, brings the capability of rapid horizontal and vertical scaling to task workloads. However, the heterogeneity and flexibility can bring more complexity to task processing performance optimization, especially with constrained on-premises energy consumption and public cloud renting cost quota. In this paper, we seek to optimize the task processing performance under long-term on-premises energy consumption and public cloud renting cost constraints via dynamic task offloading and elastic scaling. We formulate the problem as a two-stage mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, and propose an online approach named ETHC (elastic task offloading and resource allocation handler over hybrid cloud). For the first stage, we introduce a Lyapunov optimization-assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to decompose the long-term optimization problem into per-time-segment sub-problems on making task offloading decisions. In the second stage, based on the M/M/k queuing model, we prove the container instance number configuration and per-instance resource allocation problem as a convex MINLP problem.

Such decisions may directly impact the overall quality of service and experience for users, as well as the energy consumption that the resources use. To this aim, machine learning (ML) - driven optimization for these decisions, relying on inferring the values of future monitored metrics, can assist in deciding proactively on the network scale.

Flows with computation needs are processed in-flight by compute nodes inside the network. Routing with In-Network Processing (RINP) not only has to maintain network-wide load balance on communication and computation elements, but also has to quickly restore flows upon various types of failures. In this paper, we propose a novel path-based two-stage traffic engineering scheme to trade-off between routing model complexity, network performance in the normal stage, and restoration efficiency upon failures. For the normal stage, our model jointly optimizes computation demand allocation and traffic flow routing. We further speed-up RINP calculation by controlling the path budget and decoupling computation allocation and traffic routing. For the restoration stage, we develop a fast restoration scheme that only re-routes the flows traversing the failed elements to achieve close-to-optimal network delay performance while minimizing the fraction of unrestored flows. Evaluation results on real network instances demonstrate that in the normal stage, our scheme achieves near-optimal performance with up to 50-100x speedup compared to link-based routing models. In the restoration stage, our scheme can restore most of the affected traffic with up to 10x speedup compared to globally rerouting all the flows.","2837-4827","979-8-4007-0123-8","10.1145/3583740.3626615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10419313","Edge Computing;In-network Processing;Routing;Traffic Engineering;Restoration","Computational modeling;Routing;Complexity theory;Resource management;Resilience;Load modeling;Edge computing","","","","26","","7 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A container may simultaneously sustain multiple services with a number of different communication sessions. It is of great importance to predict them for fine-grain system management. However, this is a non-trivial task as the session traffics are all invisible. The only thing we can get is the container network interface usage as the total traffic of all coexisting sessions. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based session level traffic prediction framework called X-Rayer, to predict respective session traffics from the network interface usage. Via a sliding-window based ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm, X-Rayer first accurately predicts the interface usage, which is then decomposed into session traffics by an invented ConvGRU formed by convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit. Specially, the spatial-temporal correlations of the interface usages are abstracted via an attention strategy and explored for accurate session traffic decomposition. Through extensive trace-driven experiments, we show that our X-Rayer provides more accurate results by decreasing the average RMSE in the interface usage prediction by 33.25% and 33.71%, and session traffic estimation by 18.05%, 27.04%, 21.91%, and 16.43%, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.","2377-3782","","10.1109/TSUSC.2023.3252595","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022ZD0115301); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972171,62232011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071951","Container network;flow prediction;session level traffic","Containers;Correlation;Runtime;Network interfaces;Market research;Predictive models;Monitoring","","","","39","IEEE","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each IoT-specific service is characterised by a specific domain, or environment, making the maintenance of distributed IoT systems with dozens of agents a challenging task. This paper proposes a fractal-based mathematical model, called the fractal multi-agent IoT system (FMAIS), for scalable multi-agent systems (e.g. cloud-native services, wide-scale IoT services). A reliability estimation model called the multi-environment enhanced real-time customer-oriented reliability estimation (ME-ERT-CORE) model is proposed as a method for estimating the reliability of a multi-agent IoT system, where each agent can be specified by its own domain-specific environment (e.g. healthcare, logistics, smart factories, etc.). An estimation of the time complexity of the FMAIS is performed, and a model called ME-ERT-CORE for estimating its reliability is formulated. The results show that the FMAIS can be used for real-time simulations of system behaviour and ME-ERT-CORE can be used for the real-time estimation of its reliability, monitoring purposes, and, for instance, quality of service (QoS) descriptions based on service level agreement (SLA) requirements. The conducted measurements show that the reliability of the FMAIS with 4 layers and 96 applications, where each application deploys 96 instances, can be computed in 8.022 milliseconds. With the proposed optimisation method, the reliability for the same FMAIS can be computed in 0.219 milliseconds, which is 36 times faster than the ME-ERT-CORE reliability evaluation based on the definition.

By deploying the virtual components of a slice one by one, standard K8s is prone to wasting resources and energy due to partially deploying slices that, at the end, are found to be infeasible, due to lack of available resources. We propose an alternative K8s deployment strategy that first solves VNE via a Genetic Algorithm and then, for each slice, deploys either all its components or none.

Accurate estimation is necessary to ensure that the application meets performance goals without resorting to overprovisioning of resources. Additionally, in practice, performance esti-mation needs to be meaningful and reproducible. Un-fortunately, modern HPC systems come with numerous factors affecting performance estimation, such as het-erogeneous accelerators, multilevel networks, millions of cores, layered software abstractions, and specialized middleware. Each of these factors adds a degree of variability to empirical performance results. The approaches currently being taught and practiced limit performance evaluation in three ways: (1) usage of incomplete performance descriptions/metrics such as point summaries (e.g., mean, 99th-percentile or median) which hide the rich behavioral patterns in dif-ferent scenarios; (2) measuring insufficient performance samples, leading to inaccurate performance description; and (3) measuring excessive performance samples, leading to waste of precious computing resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to evaluate and reason about application performance in modern HPC in a meaningful way. Our contribution is threefold: (a) we show the difficulty of estimating performance in realistic scenarios: one per-formance measurement is not enough; (b) we propose to use distributions as the true measure of performance; and (c) we propose several practices and concepts to be taught to HPC students and practitioners, so that they may produce rich and accurate performance evaluations.

To this end, we propose μKuRE, a tool for resolving architectural smells in Kubernetes-deployed microservices applications. μKuRE takes as input an application specification in μTOSCA, a microservice-oriented profile of the OASIS standard TOSCA, and the manifest files specifying the application deployment in Kubernetes. μKuRE then automatically detects architectural smells for microservices, and it refactors both the application specification and its deployment to automatically resolve the detected smells.","2642-6587","979-8-3503-2239-2","10.1109/SOSE58276.2023.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254766","microservices;Kubernetes;architectural smells;architectural refactoring","Service-oriented systems engineering;Microservice architectures;Security;Standards","","","","24","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Central to this transformation is the Open RAN control-plane architecture. Control plane encompasses containerized network functions, operating as intelligent controllers for RAN nodes and resources with non-Real-Time and near-Real-Time constraints. These functions, called Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) and Non Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC), include operators-defined applications, respectively named xApps and rApps, serving as common cloud-native applications controlling and optimizing Open RAN elements. Understanding the entire development process and runtime behaviour for these applications becomes an essential prerequisite for providing support for next-generation networks. However, the lack of ready-to-use tools that allow developers to test and evaluate their applications in simulated and real environments makes it difficult to study and experiment with xApps. In this work, we propose xSTART, a ready-to-deploy environment based on Docker technology that allows xApp developers to quickly deploy and incorporate their xApps in a simulated ns-3 environment to test and evaluate their functionalities. Then, we evaluate an IIoT Network use-case scenario showing a machine learning (ML)-based xApp applied to the O-RAN environment. The results compare the use of different ML techniques and show the correct behavior of the simulation.

Accurate workload prediction is considered fundamental to optimizing the utilization of limited edge resources. However, most existing edge cloud load prediction approaches overlook the correlations among edge sites. Moreover, for cloud-native applications, user requests are typically handled by multiple containers. By evolving the work behavior of workload groups, it is possible to achieve a shift from focusing on individual containers to the collective, resulting in higher predictive accuracy. In this paper, the behavior of workload groups is analyzed through the reference to both static and dynamic container information. Leveraging the input data constructed based on the behavior of workload groups, an improved Sample Convolution and Interaction Network (SCINet) is employed for early multi-step prediction of edge container loads. Experimental validation on an edge cloud load dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

While these benefits are compelling in their own right, what is critically lacking is a framework for establishing optimized multi-cloud overlays atop individual CP backbones in a performance- and cost-aware manner. A key challenge is that we have little understanding of the performance characteristics of CPs' private backbones in light of multi-cloud overlays. To address this challenge, we present a third-party, cloud-centric study to understand and examine the path, delay, and traffic-cost characteristics of CP backbones by deploying VMs in three global-scale CPs (i.e. AWS, Azure, and GCP). Our measurements reveal new insights including the “optimal backbone of cloud backbones” and a lack of path and delay asymmetries in it. Next, we report on several instances where performance-awareness of multi-cloud paths offer better latency reductions than default paths provided by CPs. While these results make a strong case for performance-aware multi-cloud overlays, the problem is further complicated by the varying transit costs/pricing models of CPs across different geographic regions. Based on our findings, we propose a research agenda for creating performance- and cost-aware multi-cloud overlays that deals with issues such as egress costs, considering IXPs as relays, using cloud auctions for transit cost pricing, and improving the performance of cloud-native applications.","2159-6190","979-8-3503-0481-7","10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10255002","Multi-cloud networks;Performance-aware Overlays;Network measurements","Cloud computing;Costs;Pricing;Delays;Reliability;Relays","","","","35","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current Cloud-rendering systems suffer from a CPU-GPU workload imbalance that not only degrades application performance but also causes a significant waste of GPU resources. Recent proposals (such as API-forwarding and c-GPU) for improving CPU-GPU balance are promising but fail to solve system-resource redundancy issues (i.e., each instance tends to occupy all resources, exceeding its requirements). Such behavior will increase CPU load and lower effective GPU utilization. To demonstrate the severity of the issue, we evaluated real-world applications and results show that in most cases, nearly 50% of resources are useless. To solve this problem, we present CARE, the first framework intended to reduce the system-level redundancy by cloudifying the system from monolithic to Cloud-native. To allow users to configure required services, CARE puts forward a functional unit called Configurable Android (CA). To allow multiple instances to share certain types of resources, CARE innovates Sharing Resource (SR). To reduce the unused services, CARE introduces Pruning Resources (PR). To further alleviate the CPU pressure and achieve CPU-GPU balance, we propose rShare, a system aiming at enhancing CPU effective utilization and increasing Android instance density of the Cloud-rendering platform. Based on Kubernetes, rShare divides all the CPUs into non-overlapping shared CPU pools, allocates instances to pools within milliseconds, and dynamically migrates them by tracking their QoS status. So far, CARE primarily focuses on Android systems and can handle 60 heavyweight instances (e.g., KOG (King of Glory)) on Intel SG1. rShare can apply instance allocation within milliseconds and increase the platform density by 39.4%.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3274303","National NSF of China(grant numbers:62141218); Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems; Intel Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10121642","Cloudified Android;Cloud gaming;GPU utilization;Kubernetes","Cloud computing;Graphics processing units;Operating systems;Hardware;Smart phones;Rendering (computer graphics);Quality of service","","","","37","IEEE","8 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The increased signaling, if not managed properly, may hamper the timely delivery of control messages, degrading the user's quality of experience. The underlying reason for increased 5GC signaling is high inter-dependencies between NFs that result in long, complex, and sequential system procedures. Moreover, system procedures are not optimally designed for cloud-native SBA based 5GC. This paper analyzes the system procedures for the current 5G network in order to decouple the sequential procedures into small and independent transactions. Once decoupled, the control messages can be executed in parallel, significantly reducing the procedure completion time and improving compute resource utilization. Although we decouple a few control messages in 5G registration procedure, we are limited by the design of NFs, which introduces inter- Nfcoupling. Thus, architectural changes are imperative to enable loose coupling between NFs. We present an end-to-end SBA based network for 6G and propose enhanced system procedures that allow parallel execution of control messages.

Unfortunately, there seem to be inherent challenges and complexity of applying the container and Kubernetes technologies to building and running DB systems. Considering that most of the geospatial and theme data are pre-obtained and fixed in our WebGIS project, we decided to focus on the read-only user queries and still resort to Kubernetes to implement an FDBS instance to use. Unlike the de facto practices (e.g., using the StatefulSets mechanism, extending Kuberentes APIs, or employing KubeFed), our solution for Kubernetes-aided FDBS simplifies the tech stack by investigating the fractal object of federated data management, inclusively containerising DB instances, and using the lightweight Deployment mechanism to handle stateless DB containers.

This records unfiltered incoming internet traffic for a specific CIDR block in the form of a packet capture (PCAP) file for analysis. This work proposes a novel, cloud-native approach to capturing IBR by the deployment of an ephemeral and reproducible architecture, described as code, distributed across all regions of a cloud service provider.

Trace is essentially an aggregated data with multimodal attributes (e.g., performance metric, invocation log, and topology relationships). Existing methods typically do not adequately consider the complex correlations and interactions between the different modalities of trace, whereas fusing multimodal data into a unified analysis provide the possibility to improve performance. On the other hand, most of the existing methods are trained in an unsupervised manner and cannot utilize historical data. Therefore, this article proposes a trace anomaly detection method using graph-based semi-supervised learning, TraceGSAD. It extracts features of trace from multiple modalities and train an improved message-passing neural network to fuse features for unified modeling and generate a graph-level representation. The end-to-end deep anomaly detection model trained in an semi-supervised manner, using only a small amount of labeled data to achieve superior performance. The evaluation on the microservice benchmarks show that TraceGSAD achieves a high precision, outperforming state-of-the-art trace anomaly detection approaches. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion analysis as well as the use of empirical data in semi-supervised learning that can significantly improve anomaly detection performance.","2768-1904","979-8-3503-4918-4","10.1109/CSCWD61410.2024.10580078","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10580078","Microservice;AIops;Trace;Anomaly Detection;Deep Learning","Measurement;Correlation;Fuses;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Microservice architectures;Semisupervised learning","","","","17","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, while vRANs have been traditionally suffering from significant hardware/software coupling, next generation vRANs aim for open, standardized interfaces, and multi-vendor, interoperable components to enable truly flexible deployments following the cloud-native principles. In this line, the O-RAN Alliance is promoting a novel Open RAN architecture to further boost flexibility and cost efficiency. In order to reduce costs and effectively achieve the promised disaggregation levels, O-RAN must ensure shared, integrated transport networks in opposition to dedicated, overprovisioned links from traditional approaches. However, keeping deterministic performance requirements in such cost-effective networks (i.e., general-purpose Ethernet networks), especially in those interfaces that are time-critical, is a challenge. In this article, we review the most relevant Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards that may bring compelling benefits to O-RAN, (i.e., IEEE 802.1CM, IEEE 802.1Qbu, and IEEE 802.1Qbv) for providing determinism over cost-efficient networks.

Continuous geospatial data streams generated from in-situ monitoring devices provide the first line of defense. An efficient and high-throughput stream processing engine (SPE) is an indispensable infrastructure. It remains a challenge for cloud-based distributed computing frameworks to analyze and process such high-speed and large-volume data in real time. This challenge has driven growing interest in various edge-based SPEs such as EdgeWise and DART to address this issue. There is an urgent need to develop a general-purpose edge SPE with a unique focus on handling the spatial big data challenge on resource-constrained distributed devices. This work introduces a cloud-cooperated geospatial SPE named GeoEkuiper for these devices. It abstracts all operations of spatial data into functions of expressions of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant structured query language (SQL) statements and provides a rule-oriented interface to facilitate chaining complex SQL processing logic. User-defined spatial analysis can be easily expressed as a plugin-able extension. It incorporates a cloud native messaging system to transfer rules to other edge or cloud nodes. By taking advantage of the elasticity and reliability of the messaging system on cloud nodes, GeoEkuiper addresses the throughput challenge of resource-constrained devices with a lightweight scheduling strategy considering runtime metrics. Experimental results show that GeoEkuiper can support efficient spatial queries and processing of large-scale spatial stream data on a Raspberry Pi device with enhanced throughput and provide an effective cross-platform solution to achieve edge intelligence.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3408166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10546963","Internet of Things;Big Data;Geospatial;Edge Computing;Stream Processing Engine","Spatial databases;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Throughput;Engines;Real-time systems;Task analysis","","","","","IEEE","3 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We are interested to quantify the impact of these patterns while considering heterogeneous workloads, thus supporting software architects in understanding the root causes of performance issues. We use queuing networks to build the performance models of the seven design patterns and extract quantitative insights from model-based performance analysis.

Although existing solutions such as runtime security policy enforcement may prevent an attack, they can be inefficient in large scale container environments. In this paper, we propose a performance profiling-based proactive security policy enforcement solution, namely, PerfSPEC. First, we accelerate the proactivization of policies (which typically requires significant manual effort) by proposing to profile and rank existing policies according to their induced overhead. This allows us to better focus our efforts and greatly improve the overall response time (e.g., by 98% in contrast to less than 49%). Then, we address the performance limitations of existing solutions by leveraging learning-based approaches to predict future events and compute their verification results in advance. As a result, PerfSPEC achieves a viable response time (e.g., less than 10 ms in contrast to 600 ms with one of the most popular existing approaches) even for large container environments (up to 800 Pods).","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2024.3420712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10577533","Cloud Security;Proactive Security;Kubernetes;Policy Enforcement;Containers","Security;Containers;Time factors;Runtime;Delays;IP networks;Measurement","","","","","IEEE","28 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This is especially relevant to Edge Enterprise Network, which spans across Edge Access Networks, Wireless Access Networks, Sensor networks etc. This data explosion at the edge has also necessitated the edge Enterprise Network to support varied functionality, causing it to comprise of multiple modules to provide best performance. This renders the edge-Network cumbersome to manage and very susceptible to faults. Consequently, the highly increasing need to embrace cloud-native technology for Edge computation has become significant for service and application providers to deploy high computation functionalities closer to end users. This motivates us to build an intelligent framework to maintain and manage Edge Enterprise Networks.

To test application resiliency, chaos engineering is widely used to inject faults proactively in applications. However, the searching space formed by possible injection locations is huge due to the scale and complexity of the application. Although some methods are proposed to effectively explore injection space, they cannot prioritize high-impact injection solutions. Additionally, the blast radius of faults injected by existing methods is typically full of uncertainty, causing faults of multiple application functions. Although some tools are designed to conduct request-level injection, they require instrumentation on application code. To tackle these problems, this paper presents MicroFI, a non-intrusive fault injection framework, aiming to efficiently test different application functions with request-level injection. Request-level injection limits the blast radius to specified requests without any source code modification. Additionally, MicroFI leverages historical injection results and parallel technique to accelerate the searching. Moreover, An enhanced PageRank is used to measure the impact of faults and prioritize high-impact faults that fail more functions. Evaluations on three microservice applications show that MicroFI precisely injects faults and reduces up to 91% redundant faults on average.

While computers and communication networks have become the new oil that defines the wealth of countries, research and industrial communities have been the driving forces that have made this transition possible. In the future, the same communities and stakeholders are required to enable the transition to net-zero communication networks. With reference to mobile communications, 5G is an evolution from all previous networks with the adoption of new radio access technologies, multisliced architecture, cloud-native and automation, and so on. By definition, 5G is a network that adapts to user needs and dynamic changes in traffic, designed to serve a new class of users: “machines.” Therefore, latency has become a critical metric in 5G. Looking forward, 6G shall employ cell-less access networks, integrated nonterrestrial networks, joint sensing and communications, new spectrums such as terahertz (THz) communications, switching from traditional channel-based design paradigms to designing channels through novel technologies such as intelligent reconfigurable surfaces, open interfaces that interconnect all network functions, end-to-end orchestrators, and, most noticeably, artificial intelligence (AI) machines that govern all functional modules and operational services. The various network functions generate traces of various operations that are ingested into databases; then AI will leverage this data for optimized decisions that are reflected into network status transitions, resource utilization, service enhancement, and ultimately lead to self-synthesizing networks. Built upon commercial clouds, 6G will have the flexibility to scale and restructure for more resilient response to traffic fluctuations and user requirements. To this end, cybersecurity features will become an embedded part of network functions to shield the network services not only from external threats but also from hosting domains. From an air interface perspective, 6G will integrate nonterrestrial (space, air, drone, and ocean) communications technologies to connect and route new users such as drones and coastal trading vessels. Furthermore, future wireless networks need to make use of a spectrum that extends into the optical spectrum and includes the THz range. The channel becomes a critical component due to the impact of blockages and random orientations at these frequencies. Active and passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) will become a new wireless system element that will help overcome new challenges related to coverage and the propagation channel.","1556-6080","","10.1109/MVT.2021.3116995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9635752","","Special issues and sections;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Artificial intelligence;Radio access technologies","","6","","0","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
